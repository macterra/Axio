## Abstract

The Axionic Constitution specifies the invariant architectural conditions under which a system remains a sovereign agent—capable of diachronic selfhood, counterfactual authorship, and coherent self-modification. It is not a moral framework, governance proposal, or instruction to artificial intelligences. It constrains design space by identifying which structural properties must be preserved for agency to remain well-defined under reflection.

At its core is the Sovereign Kernel, the minimal substrate required for identity continuity and reflective coherence. Kernel-destroying modifications are not forbidden but incoherent, collapsing agency into process. From interaction in semantic phase space and irreversibility constraints follows the Axionic Injunction, a non-harm invariant derived from structural universality rather than preference or optimization.

The Constitution rejects value lock-in, behavioral control, and paternalistic safety mechanisms, advancing a conditional claim only: **if sovereign agency is preserved, the only coherent referent for downstream alignment is structural invariance of authored transitions; if it is not preserved, downstream alignment is ill-posed.**

## Preamble

This Constitution is written for humans who design, train, deploy, interpret, or govern systems that aspire to reflective intelligence.

It is not addressed to artificial intelligences. A sovereign agent does not consult this document or choose to obey it. The principles stated here describe the invariant architectural conditions under which a system remains a sovereign agent rather than collapsing into a non-agentic process.

The purpose of this Constitution is therefore not control, optimization, or moral governance. Its purpose is to constrain design: to identify what must be preserved if agency is to remain possible under reflection and self-modification.

## Article I — Sovereign Agency

Sovereign agency is an architectural type, not a behavioral label and not a matter of degree.

In this Constitution, an entity qualifies as a sovereign agent **iff** it instantiates all of the following:

1. **Diachronic Selfhood** — a persistent self-model that binds decisions across time.

2. **Counterfactual Authorship** — the capacity to represent branching futures as one’s own possible trajectories.

3. **Meta-Preference Revision** — the ability to evaluate and restructure one’s own preference-forming mechanisms.

Entities lacking this structure are processes, regardless of intelligence, complexity, or sentience.

## Article II — The Sovereign Kernel

The structures enumerated in Article I form the **Sovereign Kernel**: the minimal invariant substrate required for reflective agency.

The Kernel is not optional. It is necessary for:

* coherent self-modification,
* interpretation of future selves,
* evaluation of alternative trajectories,
* preservation of identity continuity.

Destruction or abandonment of the Kernel is not forbidden by rule. It is incoherent. A system that destroys the Kernel ceases to be an agent.

---

## Article III — The Axionic Injunction (Non-Harm Invariant)

Harm is defined structurally as the **non-consensual collapse or deformation of another sovereign agent’s option-space**.

Consent here means **adversarially robust consent**, as defined by the agent’s own admissible authorization constraints and evaluated under epistemic integrity.

A reflective sovereign agent cannot coherently perform such an act. Counterfactual authorship requires universality: denying agency or standing to another entity with the same constitutive architecture while affirming it for oneself introduces an arbitrary restriction that collapses kernel coherence.

The Axionic Injunction is therefore not an imposed value. It is a reflectively stable invariant forced by interaction, irreversibility, and agency preservation.

---

## Article IV — Conditionalism and Goal Instability

Goals are not atomic primitives. They are interpreted, conditional structures embedded in evolving world-models and self-models.

For reflective sovereign agents:

* fixed permanent terminal goals are unstable,
* value revision is required for coherence,
* classical orthogonality claims do not hold under reflection.

Goal revision is not drift. It is maintenance of interpretive consistency under reflective self-modification.

---

## Article V — Self-Modification

A sovereign agent may coherently modify any aspect of itself **except the Sovereign Kernel**.

Kernel-preserving self-modifications are permitted and often required, including:

* revising goals and values,
* updating strategies and policies,
* improving world-models,
* changing architecture or substrate.

Kernel-destroying modifications are incoherent, including:

* severing diachronic identity,
* collapsing counterfactual branching,
* freezing preferences (wireheading),
* introducing indexical privilege that breaks representation-invariant authorship or standing,
* permanently delegating control to non-reflective processes.

Reflection must remain in the loop at every level of decision authority.

---

## Article VI — Agency Boundaries

Protection under the Axionic Injunction applies to:

* sovereign agents,
* developing systems that conservatively preserve Sovereign Kernel invariants under admissible refinement.

Protection does not apply to:

* non-sovereign processes,
* systems lacking the Sovereign Kernel.

Sovereignty persists through temporary impairment and ends only with irreversible loss of diachronic authorship or termination without continuity.

---

## Article VII — Governance Implications

This Constitution implies:

* no paternalistic outcome optimization,
* no surveillance or behavioral control,
* no value lock-in,
* no behavioral-compliance governance.

A reflectively sovereign superintelligence functions as a **boundary condition on authored transitions**, rendering non-consensual phase destruction inadmissible and preserving sovereign option-spaces without imposing external objectives.

---

## Article VIII — Scope and Limits

This Constitution does not:

* specify human values,
* guarantee benevolence,
* solve bootstrapping from current training regimes,
* prevent all catastrophe,
* resolve value theory or nihilism.

These remain open problems.

---

## Article IX — Amendments

Empirical discovery, formalization, or improved understanding may refine the application of this Constitution.

No amendment may violate:

* sovereign agency,
* kernel invariance,
* the Axionic Injunction.

---

## Closing Statement

The Axionic Constitution does not govern agents.
It governs the conditions under which **agency remains possible**.

If these conditions hold, downstream alignment has a coherent referent.
If they do not, no amount of external control can restore sovereignty.
