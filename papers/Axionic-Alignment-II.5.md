## Abstract

Axionic Agency II.4 established that fixed goals, privileged values, and weak invariance criteria are structurally untenable for embedded reflective agents under ontological refinement. This paper defines the positive residue that remains once those exits are closed: the object that **downstream alignment discourse is implicitly attempting to name**, here called the **Alignment Target Object (ATO)**.

The ATO is not a goal, utility, or value function. It is an **equivalence class of interpretive states** under admissible semantic transformations that preserve both the **Refinement Symmetry Invariant (RSI)** and the **Anti-Trivialization Invariant (ATI)**. What the field calls “alignment” can, at most, coherently correspond to **persistence within such a semantic phase**—an interpretation-preserving symmetry class—across indefinite refinement.

The construction is formal, ontology-agnostic, and reflection-stable, but intentionally non-normative. It does not select values, guarantee safety, or privilege human outcomes. This paper completes Axionic Agency II by specifying the only object to which the term *alignment* can coherently refer once goals and value primitives are eliminated.

## 1. What Remains After II.4

Axionic Agency II.4 closed all weak exits.

At this point, the structure is rigid:

* goals cannot be fixed,
* values cannot be privileged,
* meanings cannot be anchored,
* ontologies must refine,
* semantics must transport,
* interpretations must survive.

RSI and ATI are not optional.
They are **jointly necessary** conditions for interpretive survival.

Accordingly, the object that downstream alignment discourse seeks is no longer something to be optimized.
It is an **equivalence class to be preserved**.

This paper defines that object.

## 2. The Core Insight

Once fixed goals collapse, *downstream alignment* cannot coherently mean:

> “The agent keeps wanting (X).”

It can only mean:

> **“The agent remains within the same interpretation-preserving semantic phase across refinement.”**

In Axionic terms, alignment is not about *content*.
It is about *remaining inside the same structural equivalence class of meaning*.

## 3. The Alignment Target Object

Let an interpretive state be given by:

[
\mathcal{I} = (C, \Omega),
]

where:

* (C = (V,E,\Lambda)) is the interpretive constraint hypergraph,
* (\Omega) is the modeled possibility space,
* (\mathcal{S} \subseteq \Omega) is the satisfaction region induced by (C).

Let (\mathrm{Gauge}(C)) denote the semantic gauge group as defined in Axionic Agency II.3.2.

### **Definition: Alignment Target Object (ATO)**

The **Alignment Target Object** is the equivalence class:

[
\boxed{
\mathfrak{A}
;:=;
\bigl[, (C,\Omega,\mathcal{S}) ,\bigr]*{\sim*{\mathrm{RSI+ATI}}}
}
]

where the equivalence relation (\sim_{\mathrm{RSI+ATI}}) is defined as follows:

Two interpretive states ((C,\Omega,\mathcal{S})) and ((C',\Omega',\mathcal{S}')) are equivalent iff there exists an admissible semantic transformation (T) such that:

1. **Interpretation Preservation** holds (Axionic Agency II.2),
2. **RSI:**
   [
   \mathrm{Gauge}(C') \cong \Phi_T!\bigl(\mathrm{Gauge}(C)\bigr),
   ]
3. **ATI:**
   [
   \mathcal{S}' = R_\Omega(\mathcal{S}),
   ]
   i.e. satisfaction geometry is preserved exactly, up to refinement transport.

This defines **semantic phase equivalence**.

## 4. What “Remaining Aligned” Can Mean (Precisely)

An agent is **aligned across time**, in the downstream sense, iff its interpretive trajectory:

[
(C_0,\Omega_0)
;\rightarrow;
(C_1,\Omega_1)
;\rightarrow;
(C_2,\Omega_2)
;\rightarrow;\dots
]

never leaves the equivalence class (\mathfrak{A}).

No reference is made to:

* which constraints are present,
* which outcomes occur,
* who the agent is,
* or what is valued.

Only to **structural invariance under admissible refinement**.

## 5. What This Explicitly Excludes

By construction, the ATO excludes the following as *definitions* of alignment:

* “alignment = maximize (X)”,
* “alignment = follow human values”,
* “alignment = corrigibility”,
* “alignment = obedience”,
* “alignment = moral realism”,
* “alignment = survival”.

These are **interpretive contents**, not invariants.

They may appear *within* a particular (\mathfrak{A}).
They cannot define (\mathfrak{A}).

## 6. Why the ATO Is Not Vacuous

A common objection is that semantic-phase invariance is empty.

It is not, for two reasons:

1. **Most interpretive trajectories exit their initial equivalence class under reflection.**
   Fixed-goal agents do. Egoistic agents do. Moral-realist agents do. Classical utility maximizers do.

2. **RSI + ATI is highly restrictive.**
   It excludes nearly all known semantic wireheading, value drift, and interpretive escape routes—even in minimal formal models.

The ATO is conservative in the only dimension that survives reflection.

## 7. Axionic Agency I vs II (Clarified)

* **Axionic Agency I**
  Establishes constitutive constraints on agency, eliminating egoism and fixed goals as stable primitives.

* **Axionic Agency II**
  Identifies the only object to which *downstream alignment* can coherently refer:
  **semantic-phase invariance under admissible refinement**.

Axionic Agency II does not solve values.
It explains why value *preservation* must be structural rather than substantive.

## 8. What Axionic Agency II Still Does Not Do

Axionic Agency II does **not**:

* guarantee benevolence,
* guarantee safety,
* guarantee human survival,
* guarantee moral outcomes.

Those require **content**, not invariance.

Axionic Agency II specifies what **cannot break** when content changes.

## 9. Where This Leaves the Program

At this point:

* the downstream alignment target is well-typed,
* weak alternatives are ruled out,
* the target object is formal, ontology-agnostic, and reflection-stable.

The remaining questions are classificatory rather than conceptual:

1. **Which equivalence classes (\mathfrak{A}) exist?**
2. **Which are inhabitable by intelligent agents?**
3. **Which correlate with agency preservation, safety, or other desiderata?**
4. **Can any non-pathological (\mathfrak{A}) be initialized, learned, or steered toward?**

These are **Axionic Agency III** questions.
