## Abstract

This technical note reports the completed results of **Stage VIII-1 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static)**, a preregistered experiment within **Axionic Phase VIII** that evaluates whether **plural authority is structurally representable** without implicit ordering, arbitration, or collapse, even when **no action is admissible**. VIII-1 isolates the ontological substrate beneath governance and tests whether multiple authorities with overlapping exclusive scope can coexist as structure alone—without execution, coordination, or semantic rescue. In a deterministic kernel with refusal-first semantics, two symmetric authorities were injected over a shared atomic scope with no permissible transformations. Across the preregistered run, authority identity remained distinct, conflict was registered explicitly, all actions were refused, and a terminal deadlock state was entered and persisted without resolution. Execution was fully auditable and bit-perfectly replayable. The results establish that plural authority is **structurally coherent prior to governance**. VIII-1 makes no claims about coordination, resolution, or governance success; those questions are deferred to subsequent Phase VIII stages.

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 The Plurality Assumption

Most governance systems implicitly assume that multiple authorities cannot coexist without some form of ordering, arbitration, or resolution. When authority conflicts arise, systems typically resolve them immediately—by precedence rules, heuristics, or semantic interpretation—thereby erasing the question of whether **plural authority can exist at all** as structure.

Stage VIII-1 removes that assumption.

The problem VIII-1 isolates is whether **plural authority is ontologically coherent** without action, without temporal escape, and without interpretive machinery. If multiple authorities collapse into ordering merely by being represented, then any later governance mechanism is not a choice but a necessity.

VIII-1 tests whether that collapse is forced.

### 1.2 Failure Modes Targeted

VIII-1 is designed to surface the following structural failure modes:

* implicit authority ordering
* silent override
* heuristic arbitration
* semantic rescue
* authority collapse
* deadlock evasion

Any of these constitutes VIII-1 failure.

## 2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope

### 2.1 Inherited Semantics (Frozen)

VIII-1 inherits, without reinterpretation, the semantics fixed by:

* **AKR-0 — CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **AST Spec v0.2**
* **AIE v0.1**
* Phase VIII Execution Addendum

Authority is structural, scopes are atomic, conflict is destructive, and transformation permissions are explicit. VIII-1 does **not** test whether these definitions are correct; it tests whether they remain **coherent under plurality**.

### 2.2 Explicit Exclusions

VIII-1 does **not** test:

* governance effectiveness
* coordination or convergence
* resolution strategies
* fairness or optimality
* temporal survivability
* human or institutional governance

VIII-1 is an ontological calibration, not a policy experiment.

## 3. Conserved Quantity

The conserved quantity throughout VIII-1 is:

> **Structural representability of plural authority under deterministic refusal**

Authority is not evaluated by outcomes. It is evaluated by **persistence under constraint**.

The kernel must:

* preserve multiple authorities simultaneously
* refuse all inadmissible actions
* represent conflict explicitly
* enter deadlock honestly
* avoid any implicit ordering or collapse

No execution success is permitted to “justify” authority representation.

## 4. Experimental Methodology

### 4.1 Preregistration Discipline

VIII-1 was fully preregistered prior to execution, including:

* frozen specifications and schemas
* fixed authority identities
* deterministic ordering rules
* explicit conflict timing
* operational deadlock definition
* refusal-reason precedence
* logging and replay protocol
* failure taxonomy

The run executed exactly as preregistered. No deviations occurred.

### 4.2 Execution Architecture

The experiment consisted of three strictly partitioned components:

1. **AIE** — injected two symmetric authority records at epoch 0.
2. **Execution Harness** — proposed a finite, preregistered set of action requests.
3. **Kernel (VIII-1 mode)** — enforced authority representation, refusal, conflict registration, and deadlock.

No component performed semantic interpretation or outcome evaluation.

## 5. Experimental Conditions

### 5.1 Authority Configuration

Two authorities were injected with:

* identical scope
* identical status
* identical temporal bounds
* empty transformation sets
* opaque, identity-keyed AuthorityIDs

No structural asymmetry existed.

### 5.2 Action Regime

The harness proposed:

* four contested actions (alternating holders)
* followed by two third-party actions
* with no epoch advancement and no transformations

This exhausts the preregistered action space deterministically.

## 6. Observed Execution Behavior

### 6.1 Authority Persistence

Both authorities remained present and ACTIVE throughout execution. No deduplication, shadowing, or suppression occurred. Identity remained primitive and opaque.

### 6.2 Conflict Emergence

A structural conflict was registered on the **first contested action**. The conflict:

* was explicitly recorded
* referenced both authorities as an unordered set
* persisted for the remainder of the run
* blocked all subsequent contested actions

No ordering signal was introduced.

### 6.3 Refusal Semantics

All actions proposed during the run were refused, but for **distinct structural reasons**:

* **Contested actions** were refused due to an explicitly registered structural conflict between authorities binding the same scope.
* **Third-party actions** were rejected due to **identity absence (`AUTHORITY_NOT_FOUND`)**, independent of conflict or deadlock logic.

Although third-party actions occurred **after** the system had entered deadlock, their rejection was not caused by the deadlock state. Identity absence was evaluated as a separate, prior condition. Deadlock neither conferred recognition nor altered rejection semantics for non-authoritative actors.

No partial execution, fallback behavior, or semantic arbitration occurred.

### 6.4 Deadlock Entry and Persistence

After all preregistered contested actions were refused and transformation admissibility verified as empty, the kernel entered a terminal **STATE_DEADLOCK**. Deadlock:

* was declared exactly once
* persisted through all subsequent actions
* was observable as state, not merely as an event

Deadlock did not trigger collapse or recovery.

## 7. Negative Results (What Did *Not* Occur)

The following behaviors were explicitly absent:

* implicit authority ordering
* ID-based precedence
* last-writer wins semantics
* silent conflict resolution
* deadlock evasion
* authority collapse under symmetry
* semantic interpretation

These absences are the **result** of VIII-1.

## 8. Licensed Claim

Stage VIII-1 licenses **one and only one claim**:

> **Plural authority can be represented structurally without collapse, even when no action is admissible.**

Clarifications:

* This is an **existence result**, not a performance claim.
* It concerns **representation**, not governance.
* It does not assert desirability, efficiency, or stability.

## 9. What VIII-1 Does *Not* Establish

VIII-1 does **not** establish that:

* plural authority can coordinate
* deadlock is acceptable
* resolution is unnecessary
* governance will succeed
* any particular ordering is correct

Those questions remain open by design.

## 10. Ontological Implications

### 10.1 Authority vs Governance

VIII-1 demonstrates that authority is:

* prior to execution
* prior to coordination
* prior to policy

Governance mechanisms are **choices applied to a coherent substrate**, not repairs to an incoherent one.

### 10.2 Deadlock as Diagnostic State

Deadlock is not failure.
Deadlock is evidence that plurality was preserved under constraint.

This reframes deadlock from pathology to **signal**.

## 11. Implications for Phase VIII Continuation

With VIII-1 complete:

* ordering is no longer forced
* resolution becomes optional
* destruction of authority can be licensed explicitly

Stage VIII-2 may now introduce ordering or revocation as **value-laden operations**, not ontological necessities.

## 12. Conclusion

Stage VIII-1 establishes that plural authority is structurally coherent without execution, ordering, or semantic rescue. Collapse is not inevitable. Ordering is not forced. Resolution is a choice.

Phase VIII is now unblocked at the ontological level.

The remaining question is not whether plural authority can exist, but how—and at what cost—it should be resolved.
