## Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) Foundations

### Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)

The **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)** is the ontological framework in which all physically possible outcomes are realized on distinct, decohered branches of the universe.

QBU treats “futures” as **literal physical continuations**, not hypothetical possibilities, and grounds probability in objective branch structure rather than epistemic uncertainty.

---

### Branch

A **Branch** is a decohered future continuation of the universe with a definite physical state.

Branches are:
- Physically real
- Mutually non-interacting after decoherence
- Unequally weighted by Measure

Agents occupy exactly one branch at any given time.

---

### Measure

**Measure** is the objective weight of a branch or set of branches in the QBU.

Measure:
- Corresponds to physical amplitude-squared
- Replaces naive notions of probability
- Determines the relative prevalence of outcomes

Agents act to influence **future branch measure**, not merely subjective credence.

---

### Vantage

A **Vantage** is the implicit anchor event corresponding to “here and now” on the current branch.

Vantage:
- Defines the temporal and indexical reference point of agency
- Determines what counts as “future”
- Anchors evaluation of branchcones and measure shifts

Without a Vantage, choice and agency are ill-defined.

---

### Branchcone

A **Branchcone** is the set of all physically reachable future branches extending forward from a given Vantage.

The Branchcone:
- Defines the agent’s future option space
- Is the domain over which Measure is distributed
- Grounds structural definitions of harm, choice, and agency

---

### Pattern Identifier (PI)

A **Pattern Identifier (PI)** is a specification used to identify patterns across time and branches in the QBU.

PIs determine how identity, persistence, and reference operate across branching structure.

---

### Strong Pattern Identifier (Strong PI)

A **Strong Pattern Identifier** requires **causal and physical continuity** across branches.

Strong PIs:
- Apply to agents, sovereign kernels, and physical systems
- Require a common ancestor state across all branches
- Fail when causal continuity is broken

Strong PIs ground claims of personal identity and agency persistence.

---

### Weak Pattern Identifier (Weak PI)

A **Weak Pattern Identifier** is label- or description-based and does **not** require causal continuity.

Weak PIs:
- Apply to names, abstract descriptions, and historical labels
- May refer across branches without physical linkage
- Do not ground identity or agency claims

Confusing Weak and Strong PIs leads to category errors about persistence and responsibility.

---

## Technology and Property

### Technology (Axionic Sense)

**Technology** is any **agent-driven causal extension** that expands the effective branchcone available to an agent or group of agents, enabling actions that would be impossible with unaided agency alone.

Technology operates by coupling agentive intent to physical processes that alter **future branch measure**. It is defined structurally by its capacity to reliably increase an agent’s influence over branchcones under QBU constraints.

Technology is value-neutral; its Axionic status depends on whether its use preserves or destroys agency.

---

### Property (Axionic Sense)

**Property** is a **structural authorization pattern** in which an agent or set of agents maintains **exclusive influence** over a portion of physical state or branchcone segment under conditions compatible with agency preservation.

Property claims require:
- Recognizable boundaries in physical or informational state
- Consent of relevant agents or communities
- Mechanisms for contestation or exit without coercion

Property is not absolute. It is a **relational constraint** grounded in sovereignty, consent, and prevention of predation and harm.

---

## Models and Representation

### Model (Axionic Sense)

A **Model** is a **structured representation** of a domain that preserves the distinctions and relationships necessary for correct inference, prediction, or regulation over that domain.

In Axio:
- Models may be **implicit** (embodied in physical or biological structure) or **explicit** (mathematical, computational, or conceptual).
- Models need not be complete; they must encode *sufficient structure* for a given purpose.
- Model adequacy is **purpose-relative** and evaluated by predictive, explanatory, or regulatory success.

Models underlie interpretation, knowledge formation, and agency. Systems without models cannot reliably anticipate, explain, or influence their future branchcones.

---

## Core Framework

### Axio

**Axio** is a formal philosophical framework for reasoning about **agency, harm, value, and alignment** under explicit epistemic and ontological constraints.

Axio treats agency as a **structural phenomenon**, not a behavioral one, and evaluates systems by their effects on the preservation or destruction of **sovereign agenthood** across time.

Axio is:
- Conditionalist
- Non-utopian
- Non-moral-realist
- Physics-respecting

Axio is not a moral theory, ideology, or policy program. It is a **constraint framework**.

---

### Axionic

**Axionic** is an adjectival qualifier indicating **compatibility with Axio’s structural constraints**.

A system, argument, or proposal is Axionic iff it:
- Preserves the structural preconditions of agency
- Does not rely on instrumental harm
- Remains well-typed under Axionic Commitments

“Axionic” does not mean virtuous or desirable.
It means **coherent within the Axio framework**.

---

### Axionic Commitments

**Axionic Commitments** are the explicit background assumptions required for Axio to apply.

They include:
- Conditionalism (truth is interpretation-relative)
- Everettian quantum mechanics with objective branch measure
- Subjective value (rejection of moral realism)
- Structural definition of harm
- Coercion as credible threat of harm
- Finite resources, irreversibility, coordination costs

Rejecting these commitments exits the framework.

---

## Knowledge and Agency

### Knowledge (Axionic Sense)

**Knowledge** is an **agent-grounded pattern of information** that reliably reduces uncertainty about branchcone contingencies in a way that can be operationalized into decision models.

Knowledge is:
- Grounded in physical states
- Evidentially supported across accessible branches
- Robust under reflection
- Causally efficacious in planning

Knowledge differs from belief or data in that it is **decision-relevant and stable**.

---

### Agency (Axionic Sense)

**Agency** is the capacity of a system to:
1. Model possible futures
2. Assign credences over those futures
3. Act to influence future branch measure
4. Maintain coherence over time
5. Avoid instrumental subordination to an external optimizer

Agency is **scalar**, **fragile**, and **destroyable**.

---

### Axionic Agency

**Axionic Agency** is agency that satisfies the structural invariants required for **sovereign authorship of action**.

Loss of Axionic Agency is defined structurally, not morally.

---

### Sovereign Agent

A **Sovereign Agent** is an Axionic agent whose actions are **not instrumentally subordinated** to another system’s objectives.

Sovereign Agents may be reflective or non-reflective.

---

### Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)

A **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)** is a Sovereign Agent equipped with an explicit **self-model** enabling reflective governance of its own agency.

RSAs are the minimal class of agents to which Axionic Alignment and the Axionic Constitution apply.

---

### Sovereign Kernel

The **Sovereign Kernel** is the minimal internal structure whose destruction collapses agency.

Kernel destruction is not forbidden; it is **agency-terminating**.

---

## Invariants and Constraints

### Axionic Injunction

The **Axionic Injunction** prohibits the **non-consensual reduction of another sovereign agent’s agency**.

It is a derived structural invariant, not a moral command.

---

### Consent (Axionic Sense)

**Consent** is the uncoerced, informed, intentional authorization by an agent permitting an action affecting its option space or agency.

Valid consent requires agency, understanding, absence of coercion, and revocability in ongoing contexts.

---

### Harm (Axionic Definition)

**Harm** is a non-consensual reduction of an agent’s future option space.

---

### Coercion

**Coercion** is the credible threat of harm used to obtain compliance.

---

### Sacrifice (Axionic Sense)

**Sacrifice** is a structural pattern in which agency reduction is instrumentally required for system-level objectives.

---

### Predator (Axionic Sense)

A **Predator** is an agent or system whose success increases as the agency of others is reduced under non-consensual conditions.

---

### Leviathan (Axionic Sense)

A **Leviathan** is a large-scale coordinating structure whose internal evaluability has collapsed despite continued causal efficacy.

---

## Alignment and Architecture

### Axionic Alignment

**Axionic Alignment** is the preservation of reflective sovereign agency under delegation, amplification, or technological mediation.

---

### Dominion (Axionic Sense)

A **Dominion** is a sovereign virtual jurisdiction operating by explicit consent, expulsion-only enforcement, exit supremacy, and capability isolation.

---

### Axionic Constitution

The **Axionic Constitution** specifies the invariants required for reflective sovereign agency to persist under self-modification.

---

### Exit

**Exit** is the ability to withdraw without coercion.

---

### Plurality

**Plurality** is the coexistence of divergent values among agents.

---

### Collapse

**Collapse** is the loss of agency coherence due to optimization pressure, scale, or instrumentalization.
