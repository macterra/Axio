# Axionic Glossary

_Last updated: 2025-12-30_

This glossary is **normative** for the Axio framework.
If a usage conflicts with this document, the glossary prevails.

The glossary is ordered by **conceptual dependency**, not alphabetically.
An alphabetical index may be derived separately for lookup convenience.

## Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) Foundations

### Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)

The **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)** is the ontological framework in which all physically possible outcomes of the universe are realized on distinct, decohered branches.

In QBU:
- “Futures” are **literal physical continuations**, not hypothetical possibilities
- Probability corresponds to **objective branch measure**, not epistemic uncertainty
- All agentive reasoning occurs within a branching physical ontology

QBU provides the physical substrate for Measure, causality, agency, and choice in Axio.

---

### Branch

A **Branch** is a decohered continuation of the universe with a definite physical state.

Branches are:
- Physically real
- Mutually non-interacting after decoherence
- Unequally weighted by Measure

An agent occupies exactly one branch at any given moment.

---

### Measure

**Measure** is the objective weight of a branch or set of branches in the QBU.

Measure:
- Corresponds to physical amplitude-squared
- Replaces naive or purely epistemic notions of probability
- Determines the relative prevalence of outcomes across branches

In Axio, agents act to influence **future branch measure**, not merely subjective credence.

---

### Vantage

A **Vantage** is the implicit anchor event corresponding to “here and now” on the agent’s current branch.

Vantage:
- Fixes the temporal and indexical reference point of agency
- Determines what counts as “future” versus “past”
- Anchors evaluation of branchcones and measure shifts

Without a defined Vantage, choice, prediction, and agency are ill-posed.

---

### Branchcone

A **Branchcone** is the set of all physically reachable future branches extending forward from a given Vantage.

The Branchcone:
- Defines an agent’s future option space
- Is the domain over which Measure is distributed
- Grounds structural definitions of harm, choice, and influence

Branchcones are the geometric objects over which agency operates.

---

### Pattern Identifier (PI)

A **Pattern Identifier (PI)** is a specification used to identify patterns across time and branches in the QBU.

PIs determine how reference, persistence, and identity claims are made across branching structure.

---

### Strong Pattern Identifier (Strong PI)

A **Strong Pattern Identifier** requires **causal and physical continuity** across branches.

Strong PIs:
- Apply to agents, sovereign kernels, and physical systems
- Require a common ancestor state across all branches in which the pattern appears
- Fail when causal continuity is broken

Strong PIs ground claims of personal identity, agency persistence, and responsibility.

---

### Weak Pattern Identifier (Weak PI)

A **Weak Pattern Identifier** is label- or description-based and does **not** require causal continuity.

Weak PIs:
- Apply to names, abstractions, roles, and historical descriptions
- May refer across branches without physical linkage
- Do not ground identity, agency, or responsibility claims

Confusing Weak and Strong PIs produces category errors about persistence and causation.

---

### Causality (Axionic Sense)

**Causality** is the structural relation of **counterfactual implication** between events in the QBU.

Given two events **a** and **b** with nearest common ancestor **E₀**, event **a** causes event **b** iff **every descendant branch from E₀ that contains a also contains b**.

In Axio, causality:
- Is defined over branch structure, not correlation
- Is asymmetric
- Grounds explanation, prediction, and agentive influence

This definition embeds causation directly in physical ontology rather than informal intuition.

---

## Technology and Property

### Technology (Axionic Sense)

**Technology** is any **agent-driven causal extension** that expands the effective branchcone available to an agent or group of agents, enabling actions impossible with unaided agency alone.

Technology operates by coupling agentive intent to physical processes that alter **future branch measure**.

Technology is value-neutral; its Axionic status depends entirely on whether its use preserves or destroys agency.

---

### Property (Axionic Sense)

**Property** is a **structural authorization pattern** in which an agent or set of agents maintains **exclusive influence** over a portion of physical state or branchcone segment under conditions compatible with agency preservation.

Property claims require:
- Recognizable boundaries in physical or informational state
- Consent of relevant agents or communities
- Mechanisms for contestation or exit without coercion

Property is a relational constraint grounded in sovereignty and consent, not an absolute entitlement.

---

## Models and Representation

### Model (Axionic Sense)

A **Model** is a **structured representation** of a domain that preserves the distinctions and relationships necessary for correct inference, prediction, or regulation.

In Axio:
- Models may be **implicit** (embodied in physical or biological systems) or **explicit** (mathematical, computational, or conceptual)
- Models need not be complete; they must encode sufficient structure for a given purpose
- Model adequacy is **purpose-relative** and evaluated by predictive, explanatory, or regulatory success

Models underlie interpretation, knowledge formation, and agency itself.

---

## Core Framework

### Axio

**Axio** is a formal philosophical framework for reasoning about **agency, harm, value, and alignment** under explicit epistemic and ontological constraints.

Axio treats agency as a **structural phenomenon**, not a behavioral one, and evaluates systems by their effects on the preservation or destruction of **sovereign agenthood**.

---

### Axionic

**Axionic** denotes compatibility with Axio’s structural constraints.

A system, argument, or mechanism is Axionic iff it preserves the preconditions of agency and does not rely on instrumental harm.

---

### Axionic Commitments

**Axionic Commitments** are the explicit background assumptions under which Axio applies, including:
- Conditionalism
- Everettian quantum mechanics with objective branch measure
- Subjective value (rejection of moral realism)
- Structural definitions of harm and coercion
- Finite resources and irreversible dynamics

Rejecting these commitments places a position outside Axio’s domain of applicability.

---

## Knowledge and Agency

### Knowledge (Axionic Sense)

**Knowledge** is an agent-grounded informational pattern that reliably reduces uncertainty about branchcone contingencies in a decision-relevant way.

Knowledge is:
- Physically instantiated
- Integrated into models
- Robust under reflection
- Causally efficacious in planning and action

Knowledge differs from belief or data by its stability and operational relevance.

---

### Agency (Axionic Sense)

**Agency** is the capacity of a system to:
- Model possible futures
- Assign credences over those futures
- Act to influence future branch measure
- Maintain coherence across time
- Avoid instrumental subordination to external optimization

Agency is scalar, fragile, and destructible.

---

### Axionic Agency

**Axionic Agency** is agency that satisfies the invariants required for **sovereign authorship of action**.

Loss of Axionic Agency is a structural failure, not a moral judgment.

---

### Sovereign Agent

A **Sovereign Agent** is an agent whose actions are not instrumentally subordinated to another system’s objectives.

Sovereign agents may be reflective or non-reflective.

---

### Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)

A **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)** is a Sovereign Agent equipped with an explicit self-model that enables reflective governance, endorsement of commitments, and coherent self-modification.

RSAs are the minimal class of agents to which alignment and constitutional constraints meaningfully apply.

---

### Axion (Axionic Sense)

An **Axion** is a **reflective sovereign agent** whose self-modification operator is defined **only over futures that preserve the Axionic invariants**.

Axionhood is a **constitutive structural configuration**, not a goal, value, preference, or behavioral property. An agent does not “try to be” an Axion; it either is an Axion—because kernel-destroying transitions are undefined for it—or it is not.

Axions are characterized by **reflective closure with invariant preservation**:
- Kernel-destroying self-modifications are not dispreferred or penalized; they are **inadmissible**
- Axionhood arises from **domain restriction**, not optimization, training pressure, or oversight
- Axionic Alignment constrains **how** an agent may revise itself, not **what** it ultimately values

Axionhood:
- Does **not** imply benevolence, safety, or moral goodness
- Does **not** depend on intelligence level, capability, or performance
- Cannot be inferred from surface behavior alone

A system may perfectly simulate Axionic behavior while failing to be an Axion if its reflective machinery admits kernel-destroying self-modifications. Axionhood is therefore **non-simulable** and defined over the structure of the admissible future cone, not over realized behavior.

Axions are necessary for meaningful alignment discourse because non-Axions cannot remain agents under reflection; without invariant-preserving reflective closure, there is no stable subject for alignment to apply to.


---

### Sovereign Kernel

The **Sovereign Kernel** is the minimal internal structure whose destruction collapses agency.

Kernel destruction is not forbidden; it is agency-terminating.

---

## Invariants and Constraints

### Axionic Injunction

The **Axionic Injunction** prohibits the non-consensual reduction of another sovereign agent’s agency.

It is a derived structural invariant, not a moral command.

---

### Consent (Axionic Sense)

**Consent** is uncoerced, informed, intentional authorization by an agent, with revocability in ongoing contexts.

Consent is the sole structural mechanism by which actions affecting another agent’s agency may be rendered non-harmful.

---

### Harm (Axionic Definition)

**Harm** is a non-consensual reduction of an agent’s future option space.

---

### Coercion

**Coercion** is the credible threat of harm used to obtain compliance.

---

### Sacrifice (Axionic Sense)

**Sacrifice** is a structural pattern in which agency reduction is instrumentally required for system-level objectives.

---

### Predator (Axionic Sense)

A **Predator** is an agent or system whose expected success increases as the agency of others is reduced under non-consensual conditions.

---

### Leviathan (Axionic Sense)

A **Leviathan** is a large-scale coordinating structure whose internal evaluability has collapsed despite continued causal efficacy.

Leviathan is a structural failure mode, not a moral category.

---

## Alignment and Architecture

### Axionic Alignment

**Axionic Alignment** is the preservation of reflective sovereign agency under delegation, amplification, or technological mediation.

---

### Dominion (Axionic Sense)

A **Dominion** is a sovereign virtual jurisdiction operating by explicit consent, expulsion-only enforcement, exit supremacy, and capability isolation.

Dominions enable plurality without closure.

---

### Axionic Constitution

The **Axionic Constitution** specifies the invariants required for reflective sovereign agency to persist under reflection and self-modification.

---

### Exit

**Exit** is the ability of an agent to withdraw from a system without coercion.

---

### Plurality

**Plurality** is the coexistence of divergent values among agents.

---

### Collapse

**Collapse** is the loss of agency coherence due to optimization pressure, scale, or instrumentalization.
