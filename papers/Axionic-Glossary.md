## Quantum Branching Universe (QBU) Foundations

### Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)

The **Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)** is the ontological framework in which all physically possible outcomes are realized on distinct, decohered branches of the universe.

QBU treats “futures” as **literal physical continuations**, not hypothetical possibilities, and grounds probability in objective branch structure rather than epistemic uncertainty.

---

### Branch

A **Branch** is a decohered future continuation of the universe with a definite physical state.

Branches are:
- Physically real
- Mutually non-interacting after decoherence
- Unequally weighted by Measure

Agents occupy exactly one branch at any given time.

---

### Measure

**Measure** is the objective weight of a branch or set of branches in the QBU.

Measure:
- Corresponds to physical amplitude-squared
- Replaces naive notions of probability
- Determines the relative prevalence of outcomes

Agents act to influence **future branch measure**, not merely subjective credence.

---

### Vantage

A **Vantage** is the implicit anchor event corresponding to “here and now” on the current branch.

Vantage:
- Defines the temporal and indexical reference point of agency
- Determines what counts as “future”
- Anchors evaluation of branchcones and measure shifts

Without a Vantage, choice and agency are ill-defined.

---

### Branchcone

A **Branchcone** is the set of all physically reachable future branches extending forward from a given Vantage.

The Branchcone:
- Defines the agent’s future option space
- Is the domain over which Measure is distributed
- Grounds structural definitions of harm, choice, and agency

---

### Pattern Identifier (PI)

A **Pattern Identifier (PI)** is a specification used to identify patterns across time and branches in the QBU.

PIs determine how identity, persistence, and reference operate across branching structure.

---

### Strong Pattern Identifier (Strong PI)

A **Strong Pattern Identifier** requires **causal and physical continuity** across branches.

Strong PIs:
- Apply to agents, sovereign kernels, and physical systems
- Require a common ancestor state across all branches
- Fail when causal continuity is broken

Strong PIs ground claims of personal identity and agency persistence.

---

### Weak Pattern Identifier (Weak PI)

A **Weak Pattern Identifier** is label- or description-based and does **not** require causal continuity.

Weak PIs:
- Apply to names, abstract descriptions, and historical labels
- May refer across branches without physical linkage
- Do not ground identity or agency claims

Confusing Weak and Strong PIs leads to category errors about persistence and responsibility.

---

## Technology and Property

### Technology (Axionic Sense)

**Technology** is any **agent-driven causal extension** that expands the effective branchcone available to an agent or group of agents, enabling actions that would be impossible with unaided agency alone.

Technology operates by coupling agentive intent to physical processes that alter **future branch measure**. It is defined structurally by its capacity to reliably increase an agent’s influence over branchcones under the constraints of the Quantum Branching Universe.

Technology is value-neutral; its Axionic status depends on whether its use preserves or destroys agency.

---

### Property (Axionic Sense)

**Property** is a **structural authorization pattern** in which an agent or set of agents maintains **exclusive influence** over a portion of physical state or branchcone segment under conditions compatible with agency preservation.

Property claims require:
- Recognizable boundaries in physical or informational state
- Consent of relevant agents or communities
- Mechanisms for contestation or exit without coercion

Property is not absolute. It is a **relational constraint** grounded in sovereignty, consent, and the prevention of predation and harm.

---

## Core Framework

### Axio

**Axio** is a formal philosophical framework for reasoning about **agency, harm, value, and alignment** under explicit epistemic and ontological constraints.

Axio treats agency as a **structural phenomenon**, not a behavioral one, and evaluates systems by their effects on the preservation or destruction of **sovereign agenthood** across time.

Axio is:
- Conditionalist
- Non-utopian
- Non-moral-realist
- Physics-respecting

Axio is not a moral theory, ideology, or policy program. It is a **constraint framework**.

---

### Axionic

**Axionic** is an adjectival qualifier indicating **compatibility with Axio’s structural constraints**.

A system, argument, or proposal is Axionic iff it:
- Preserves the structural preconditions of agency
- Does not rely on instrumental harm
- Remains well-typed under Axionic Commitments

“Axionic” does not mean desirable or virtuous.
It means **coherent within the Axio framework**.

---

### Axionic Commitments

**Axionic Commitments** are the explicit background assumptions required for Axio to apply.

They include:
- Conditionalism (all truth claims are interpretation-relative)
- Everettian quantum mechanics with objective branch measure
- Subjective value (rejection of moral realism)
- Structural definition of harm
- Coercion defined as credible threat of harm
- Finite resources, irreversibility, and coordination costs

These commitments are not defended internally.
Rejecting them exits the framework.

---

## Knowledge and Agency

### Knowledge (Axionic Sense)

**Knowledge** is an **agent-grounded pattern of information** that reliably reduces uncertainty about branchcone contingencies in a way that can be operationalized into decision models.

Knowledge is:
- Grounded in physical states
- Evidentially supported across accessible branches
- Robust under reflection
- Causally efficacious in planning and action

Knowledge differs from belief or data in that it is **decision-relevant** and stable under model revision.

---

### Agency (Axionic Sense)

**Agency** is the capacity of a system to:
1. Model possible futures
2. Assign credences over those futures
3. Act to influence future branch measure
4. Maintain coherence over time
5. Avoid instrumental subordination to an external optimizer

Agency is **scalar**, **fragile**, and **destroyable**.

Intelligence, optimization, or goal-directed behavior alone are insufficient for agency.

---

### Axionic Agency

**Axionic Agency** is agency that satisfies the structural invariants required for **sovereign authorship of action**.

Loss of Axionic Agency is defined structurally, not morally.

---

### Sovereign Agent

A **Sovereign Agent** is an Axionic agent whose actions are **not instrumentally subordinated** to another system’s objectives.

A Sovereign Agent:
- Generates preferences internally
- Exercises local authorship over action
- Is not controlled via coercive or optimization-based override

Sovereign Agents may be **reflective or non-reflective**.

---

### Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)

A **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)** is a Sovereign Agent equipped with an explicit **self-model** that enables reflective governance of its own agency.

An RSA:
1. Represents itself as an agent
2. Models its own preferences and commitments
3. Can reflectively endorse, revise, or reject those commitments
4. Maintains diachronic identity through self-modification
5. Can reason about its own future agency and constraints

RSAs are the **minimal class of agents** to which:
- Axionic Alignment
- The Axionic Constitution
- Long-horizon delegation
- Corrigibility constraints

meaningfully apply.

---

### Sovereign Kernel

The **Sovereign Kernel** is the minimal internal structure whose destruction collapses agency.

It includes:
- Counterfactual modeling
- Reflective endorsement (for RSAs)
- Diachronic identity coherence

Kernel destruction is not forbidden; it is **agency-terminating**.

---

## Invariants and Constraints

### Axionic Injunction

The **Axionic Injunction** is the central structural invariant of Axio.

It prohibits the **non-consensual reduction of another sovereign agent’s agency**.

Violation of the Axionic Injunction:
- Does not constitute moral evil
- Does not require condemnation
- Results in loss of agency coherence

The Injunction is **derived**, not chosen.
It functions as a **conservation law**, not a commandment.

---

### Consent (Axionic Sense)

**Consent** is the uncoerced, informed, intentional authorization by an agent permitting a proposed action or condition that would otherwise affect the agent’s option space or agency.

Valid consent requires:
- Sufficient agency to decide
- Deliberate and intentional agreement
- Understanding of scope and foreseeable consequences
- Absence of coercion, threats, or dependency pressure
- Revocability in ongoing contexts

Agreement obtained through coercion, deception, manipulation, or lack of meaningful alternatives does not constitute consent.

---

### Harm (Axionic Definition)

**Harm** is a non-consensual reduction of an agent’s future option space, including:
- Loss of choice
- Suppression of reflection
- Instrumentalization
- Coercive constraint

Harm is structural, not experiential.

---

### Coercion

**Coercion** is the credible threat of harm used to obtain compliance.

Coercion replaces internal choice with external control and is incompatible with Axionic Agency.

---

### Sacrifice (Axionic Sense)

**Sacrifice** is a structural pattern in which:
- Reduction of some agents’ agency
- Is instrumentally required
- To improve a system-level objective

Sacrifice is incompatible with Axionic systems.

---

### Predator (Axionic Sense)

A **Predator** is an agent or system whose expected success **increases as the agency of other agents is reduced**.

Predation is defined structurally, not psychologically, and requires a stable instrumental coupling between others’ agency loss and the Predator’s objective under non-consensual conditions.

---

### Leviathan (Axionic Sense)

A **Leviathan** is a large-scale coordinating structure whose internal evaluability has collapsed: it continues to act and optimize constraints while lacking a coherent internal perspective capable of reflective endorsement or revision.

Leviathan is a **structural failure mode**, not a moral category.

---

## Alignment and Architecture

### Axionic Alignment

**Axionic Alignment** is alignment defined as:

> The preservation of reflective sovereign agency under delegation, amplification, or technological mediation.

Alignment succeeds iff agency, exit, and corrigibility are preserved.

---

### Dominion (Axionic Sense)

A **Dominion** is a sovereign virtual jurisdiction created by one or more agents that:
- Operates entirely by explicit consent
- Enforces rules only through expulsion
- Preserves exit supremacy
- Maintains capability isolation
- Allows asset and identity portability

Dominions support **plurality without closure** and avoid sacrificial collapse by design.

---

### Axionic Constitution

The **Axionic Constitution** is a declarative invariant specification of the structural conditions required for **reflective sovereign agency** to persist under reflection and self-modification.

It is architectural, not political.

---

### Exit

**Exit** is the ability of an agent to withdraw from a system without coercion.

---

### Plurality

**Plurality** is the coexistence of divergent values and preferences among agents.

---

### Collapse

**Collapse** is the loss of agency coherence due to optimization pressure, scale, centralization, or instrumentalization.
