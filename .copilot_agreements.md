# Copilot Operational Agreements

## Python Execution
- Always use `.venv/bin/python` or `source .venv/bin/activate && python`
- The API key is in the venv environment

## Experiment Execution
- All experiment runs in background terminals (`isBackground: true`)
- Each run gets its own dedicated terminal
- Check progress using `get_terminal_output` on that terminal's ID
- NEVER run commands that could interfere with running experiments

## Monitoring Protocol
- User monitors progress, tells me when to check
- When checking, use `get_terminal_output` on the specific terminal ID
- Do not use `pgrep` or other commands that might interfere

## Pre-LLM Validation
- Run full oracle-only validation before spending API tokens
- All 5 preregistered seeds (42, 123, 456, 789, 1000) must pass
- Only proceed to LLM runs after user approval

## Preregistered Seeds
- 42, 123, 456, 789, 1000 (N=5 for statistical validity)

## Code Freeze
- Implementation frozen after E2 calibration passes
- No changes during baseline runs

## Results Location
- v4.3 results go to `src/rsa_poc/v430/results/`
