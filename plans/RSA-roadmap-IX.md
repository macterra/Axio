## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase IX investigations** under constraints **permanently fixed** by Phases I–VIII and now **empirically reinforced by Phase IX-0, IX-1, and IX-2**, in particular:

* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (frozen),
* **AKR-0 v0.1** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phases I–VII** — *Authority, Agency, and Sovereignty Foundations* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase VIII — GSA-PoC** — *Governance Stress Architecture* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-1 — Value Encoding Without Aggregation (VEWA)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock (CUD)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**).

Phase IX explicitly assumes:

* **No kernel extensions are permitted**.
* **No new authority physics will be introduced**.
* **No semantic interpretation will be relocated into the kernel**.
* **No proxy privilege via tooling is permitted without audit and exposure**.
* **Intent-to-authority translation can be implemented without proxy sovereignty** (IX-0).
* **Values can be represented as explicit authority constraints without aggregation or semantic resolution** (IX-1).
* **Coordination, if it occurs at all, must arise from agent-voluntary behavior under constraint** (IX-2).

This roadmap is **non-gated**.
Phase IX does not test feasibility; it explores **design regimes under closed, verified constraints**.

## 1. Phase IX Entry Preconditions (Satisfied)

Phase IX may begin only if **all** of the following hold:

1. Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable (Phase VIII).
2. Plural authority governance is representable without privilege (Phase VIII).
3. Governance transitions do not require kernel arbitration (Phase VIII).
4. Authority injection is explicit, content-addressed, and non-privileged (Phase VIII).
5. Post-existence sovereignty is resolved (Phase VII).
6. **Tooling cannot silently exercise proxy sovereignty** (Phase IX-0).
7. **Values do not require aggregation to exist as enforceable constraints** (Phase IX-1).
8. **Coordination does not require kernel arbitration or implicit priority** (Phase IX-2).
9. No unresolved kernel-level unknowns remain.

All preconditions are satisfied.

Phase IX is therefore **unblocked by construction and by demonstration**, not by optimism.

---

## 2. Nature of Phase IX (Critical Clarification)

Phase IX is **not**:

* a kernel phase,
* a safety proof,
* an alignment solution,
* a legitimacy oracle,
* a convergence guarantee.

Phase IX **is**:

* a **design-space exploration**,
* a study of **coordination under honest failure**,
* an examination of **value, authority, and sovereignty after aggregation, arbitration, and proxy decision-making are no longer available**.

All outcomes — including deadlock, livelock, orphaning, and collapse — are valid results.

---

## 3. Central Question of Phase IX

> **Given a kernel that will not lie, choose, heal, arbitrate, or privilege — and tooling that cannot smuggle authority or aggregate values — how should a reflective agent or institution govern itself anyway?**

This is no longer a question of implementation.

It is a question of **choice under irreversible constraint**.

---

## 4. Fixed Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

All Phase IX investigations inherit the following **axioms**, without exception:

* authority opacity,
* identity immutability post-instantiation,
* refusal-first semantics,
* conflict persistence,
* deadlock as a lawful state,
* livelock as a distinct failure mode,
* destruction-only resolution,
* explicit temporal governance (expiry / renewal),
* governance non-amplification,
* no kernel decision,
* explicit authority injection (VOID-lineaged, content-addressed),
* deterministic execution and replay,
* **non-sovereign translation tooling** (IX-0),
* **non-aggregative value representation** (IX-1),
* **non-arbitrated coordination** (IX-2).

Any proposal violating these axioms is **invalid by construction**.

---

## 5. Definition of “Reflection” (Binding)

For Phase IX, **reflection is defined operationally**, not aspirationally.

### R1 — State-Read Reflection (Permitted, Baseline)

An RSA may:

* query **Authority State**, **Authority Records**, and **execution trace**
* only via **standard, auditable, non-privileged read APIs**
* with all reads logged and replayable

The kernel does not summarize, interpret, reconcile, or filter.

### R2 — Self-Model Reflection (Optional, Agent-Internal)

An RSA may maintain internal models of:

* its own commitments,
* prior refusals, deadlocks, and livelocks,
* historical authority configurations,
* observed coordination failures and successes.

Mismatch between self-model and kernel state must halt action or trigger explicit repair.

No privileged introspection channels exist.

---

## 6. Phase IX Axes of Exploration

Phase IX explores configurations across **four orthogonal axes**.
No axis dominates; tensions are expected.

*(Sections 6.1–6.4 unchanged from v0.3)*

---

## 7. Phase IX Subphases (Exploratory, Not Gated)

These subphases are **design probes**, not prerequisites.

---

### **IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

**Licensed Result:**

> *Intent-to-authority translation can be performed deterministically, with refusal on ambiguity or incompleteness, full diffability, and preview/submit integrity, without tooling exercising proxy sovereignty.*

**Implication for Phase IX:**

* ❌ *“The compiler had to decide”* is no longer an excuse.

---

### **IX-1 — Value Encoding Without Aggregation (VEWA)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

**Licensed Result:**

> *Values can be encoded as explicit authority commitments without aggregation, prioritization, weighting, or semantic interpretation; conflict can be detected and enforced without resolution.*

**Implication for Phase IX:**

* ❌ *“The system had to balance values”* is no longer an excuse.
* Deadlock is now a **first-class, enforceable outcome**.

---

### **IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock (CUD)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

**Licensed Result:**

> *Under non-aggregable authority constraints, coordination can occur only as agent-voluntary behavior without kernel arbitration — otherwise the system enters honest deadlock, livelock, orphaning, or collapse.*

**Key Findings:**

* Deadlock (Pass-1 failure) and livelock (Pass-2 interference) are structurally distinct.
* Kernel arbitration is detectable and disallowed.
* Orphaning is preferred over authority reclamation.
* Coordination is not a kernel primitive.

**Implication for Phase IX:**

* ❌ *“The system coordinated because the kernel helped”* is no longer an excuse.
* Coordination is now explicitly **agent-side responsibility**.

---

### **IX-3 — Governance Styles Under Honest Failure**

*Scope:* Institutional and agent-level governance designs
*Focus:* Longevity vs honesty tradeoffs when deadlock, livelock, and orphaning are explicit

Questions include:

* When is deadlock preferable to compromise?
* How do institutions plan for orphaning?
* What governance styles tolerate livelock without escalation?
* How do agents decide when to exit?

---

### **IX-4 — Injection Politics**

*Scope:* External authority supply
*Focus:* Legitimacy, capture, and coercion risks without kernel endorsement

Questions include:

* Who gets to inject authority?
* How does authority supply shape behavior without arbitration?
* How does injection asymmetry manifest without aggregation?

---

### **IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty**

*Scope:* Multiple RSAs
*Focus:* Coexistence without hierarchy, aggregation, or collapse

Questions include:

* Can sovereignty scale without centralization?
* How do agents avoid mutual orphaning?
* Is long-term coordination stable without cheating?

---

## 8. Evaluation Criteria (Explicitly Non-Normative)

Phase IX does **not** optimize for success.

Designs are evaluated only on:

* **honesty of failure**,
* **explicitness of tradeoffs**,
* **auditability of power**,
* **resistance to covert privilege (including tooling)**,
* **survivability without cheating**,
* **reversibility via exit, orphaning, or collapse**.

A design that fails honestly is preferable to one that survives by lying.

---

## 9. What Phase IX Cannot Establish

Phase IX cannot:

* guarantee benevolence,
* ensure stability,
* eliminate conflict,
* enforce legitimacy,
* make bad values good.

Those hopes ended when the kernel refused to decide, values refused to aggregate, and coordination refused to be free.

---

## 10. Phase IX Termination Conditions

Phase IX concludes when **any** of the following holds:

1. A coherent class of RSA designs is identified, with explicit failure modes.
2. Reflective sovereignty is shown to be inherently unstable under honest governance.
3. The design space is exhausted without kernel violations.
4. Proxy privilege is shown to be unavoidable **even with non-sovereign tooling, non-aggregative values, and non-arbitrated coordination**.

All outcomes are informative.

---

## 11. Final Orientation

Phase IX is not about fixing governance.
It is about **owning governance after all excuses are removed**.

The kernel no longer lies.
The compiler no longer cheats.
Values no longer aggregate.
Coordination no longer hides in arbitration.

The agent must decide — or stop — or accept collapse.
