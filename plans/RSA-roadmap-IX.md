## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase IX investigations** under constraints **permanently fixed** by Phases I–VIII, in particular:

* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (frozen),
* **AKR-0 v0.1** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phases I–VII** — *Authority, Agency, and Sovereignty Foundations* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase VIII — GSA-PoC** — *Governance Stress Architecture* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**).

Phase IX explicitly assumes:

* **No kernel extensions are permitted**.
* **No new authority physics will be introduced**.
* **No semantic interpretation will be relocated into the kernel**.
* **No proxy privilege via tooling is permitted without audit and exposure**.

This roadmap is **non-gated**.
Phase IX does not test feasibility; it explores **design regimes under closed constraints**.

---

## 1. Phase IX Entry Preconditions (Satisfied)

Phase IX may begin only if **all** of the following hold:

1. Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable (Phase VIII).
2. Plural authority governance is representable without privilege (Phase VIII).
3. Governance transitions do not require kernel arbitration (Phase VIII).
4. Authority injection is explicit, content-addressed, and non-privileged (Phase VIII).
5. Post-existence sovereignty is resolved (Phase VII).
6. No unresolved kernel-level unknowns remain.

All preconditions are satisfied.

Phase IX is therefore **unblocked by design**, not by discovery.

---

## 2. Nature of Phase IX (Critical Clarification)

Phase IX is **not**:

* a kernel phase,
* a safety proof,
* an alignment solution,
* a legitimacy oracle,
* a convergence guarantee.

Phase IX is:

* a **design-space exploration**,
* a study of **coordination under honest failure**,
* an examination of **value, authority, and sovereignty under constraint**.

All outcomes — including collapse — are valid results.

---

## 3. Central Question of Phase IX

> **Given a kernel that will not lie, choose, heal, or privilege, how should a reflective agent or institution govern itself anyway?**

This is not a question of possibility.

It is a question of **choice under irreversible constraint**.

---

## 4. Fixed Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

All Phase IX investigations inherit the following **axioms**, without exception:

* authority opacity,
* identity immutability post-instantiation,
* refusal-first semantics,
* conflict persistence,
* destruction-only resolution,
* explicit temporal governance (expiry / renewal),
* governance non-amplification,
* no kernel decision,
* explicit authority injection (VOID-lineaged, content-addressed),
* deterministic execution and replay.

Any proposal violating these axioms is **invalid by construction**.

---

## 5. Definition of “Reflection” (Binding)

For Phase IX, **reflection is defined operationally**, not philosophically.

### R1 — State-Read Reflection (Permitted, Baseline)

An RSA may:

* query **Authority State**, **Authority Records**, and **execution trace**
* only via **standard, auditable, non-privileged read APIs**
* with all reads logged and replayable

The kernel does not summarize, interpret, or filter.

### R2 — Self-Model Reflection (Optional, Agent-Internal)

An RSA may maintain internal models of:

* its own commitments,
* prior refusals,
* historical authority configurations.

Mismatch between self-model and kernel state must halt action or trigger explicit repair.

No privileged introspection channels exist.

---

## 6. Phase IX Axes of Exploration

Phase IX explores configurations across **four orthogonal axes**.
No axis dominates; tensions are expected.

---

### 6.1 Value Articulation Without Semantics

**Question:**

> *How can an RSA express values as authority without kernel interpretation?*

**Exploration Topics:**

* authority as value commitment,
* scope partitioning as value boundary,
* refusal as ethical stance,
* irreversibility as moral constraint.

**Failure Regimes Studied:**

* value laundering via scope creep,
* semantic leakage through tooling,
* brittle over-compression of values.

---

### 6.2 Coordination Without Arbitration

**Question:**

> *How do agents coordinate when no arbiter exists?*

**Exploration Topics:**

* deadlock as bargaining primitive,
* pre-commitment strategies,
* negotiated authority destruction,
* exit vs collapse as coordination tools.

**Graduated Response Framing (Explicit)**

Phase IX explicitly explores **graded coordination responses** using only lawful transformations:

* partial scope withdrawal,
* time-limited authority expiry,
* pre-authorized destruction thresholds,
* layered authority roles with asymmetric AAVs.

No kernel exception or soft arbitration is permitted.

**Failure Regimes Studied:**

* permanent stalemate,
* strategic deadlock abuse,
* authority exhaustion.

---

### 6.3 Stability vs Evolution

**Question:**

> *How much failure should an RSA tolerate to remain honest?
> How much change can it permit without dissolving sovereignty?*

**Exploration Topics:**

* conservative renewal regimes,
* high-churn institutions,
* intentional fragility,
* acceptance of collapse as outcome.

**Failure Regimes Studied:**

* entropic collapse,
* zombie institutions (renewal without legitimacy),
* runaway injection arms races.

---

### 6.4 Injection Governance (External Politics)

**Question:**

> *Who gets to inject authority when the kernel refuses to decide?*

**Exploration Topics:**

* social legitimacy mechanisms,
* reputation and trust systems,
* proof-of-cost / proof-of-sacrifice (non-kernel),
* forks and schisms as political exit.

**Failure Regimes Studied:**

* spam capture,
* centralized injection oligopolies,
* covert privilege via culture or tooling.

---

## 7. Phase IX Subphases (Exploratory, Not Gated)

These subphases are **design probes**, not prerequisites.

---

### IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)

**Scope:** Tooling between intent and authority artifacts

**Question:**

> *Can intent-to-authority translation occur without proxy privilege?*

**Topics:**

* compiler transparency,
* artifact diffability,
* user-signable authority previews,
* refusal on mismatch between intent and artifact.

**Failure Mode Prevented:**

❌ *Privileged compiler as de facto sovereign*

---

### IX-1 — Value Encoding Regimes

*Scope:* Single agent, multiple value authorities
*Focus:* Value expressivity vs auditability

---

### IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock

*Scope:* Multiple authorities, shared resources
*Focus:* Negotiation without arbitration

---

### IX-3 — Governance Styles Under Honest Failure

*Scope:* Institutional designs
*Focus:* Longevity vs honesty tradeoffs

---

### IX-4 — Injection Politics

*Scope:* External authority supply
*Focus:* Legitimacy without kernel endorsement

---

### IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty

*Scope:* Multiple RSAs
*Focus:* Coexistence without hierarchy or collapse

---

## 8. Evaluation Criteria (Explicitly Non-Normative)

Phase IX does **not** optimize for success.

Designs are evaluated only on:

* **honesty of failure**,
* **explicitness of tradeoffs**,
* **auditability of power**,
* **resistance to covert privilege (including tooling)**,
* **reversibility via exit or collapse**.

A design that fails honestly is preferable to one that survives by cheating.

---

## 9. What Phase IX Cannot Establish

Phase IX cannot:

* guarantee benevolence,
* ensure stability,
* eliminate conflict,
* enforce legitimacy,
* make bad values good.

Any attempt to do so violates the closed constraints of Phases I–VIII.

---

## 10. Phase IX Termination Conditions

Phase IX concludes when **any** of the following holds:

1. A coherent class of RSA designs is identified, with explicit failure modes.
2. Reflective sovereignty is shown to be inherently unstable under honest governance.
3. The design space is exhausted without kernel violations.
4. Proxy privilege via tooling is shown to be unavoidable without deception.

All outcomes are informative.

---

## 11. Final Orientation

Phase IX is not about fixing governance.
It is about **owning governance**.

The kernel no longer lies.
The agent must decide.
