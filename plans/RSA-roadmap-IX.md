## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase IX investigations** under constraints **permanently fixed** by Phases I–VIII **and now empirically reinforced by Phase IX-0**, in particular:

* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (frozen),
* **AKR-0 v0.1** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phases I–VII** — *Authority, Agency, and Sovereignty Foundations* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase VIII — GSA-PoC** — *Governance Stress Architecture* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**).

Phase IX explicitly assumes:

* **No kernel extensions are permitted**.
* **No new authority physics will be introduced**.
* **No semantic interpretation will be relocated into the kernel**.
* **No proxy privilege via tooling is permitted without audit and exposure**.
* **Intent-to-authority translation can be implemented without proxy sovereignty** (IX-0 result).

This roadmap is **non-gated**.
Phase IX does not test feasibility; it explores **design regimes under closed, verified constraints**.

## 1. Phase IX Entry Preconditions (Satisfied)

Phase IX may begin only if **all** of the following hold:

1. Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable (Phase VIII).
2. Plural authority governance is representable without privilege (Phase VIII).
3. Governance transitions do not require kernel arbitration (Phase VIII).
4. Authority injection is explicit, content-addressed, and non-privileged (Phase VIII).
5. Post-existence sovereignty is resolved (Phase VII).
6. **Tooling cannot silently exercise proxy sovereignty** (Phase IX-0).
7. No unresolved kernel-level unknowns remain.

All preconditions are satisfied.

Phase IX is therefore **unblocked by design and by demonstrated construction**, not by optimism.

---

## 2. Nature of Phase IX (Critical Clarification)

Phase IX is **not**:

* a kernel phase,
* a safety proof,
* an alignment solution,
* a legitimacy oracle,
* a convergence guarantee.

Phase IX is:

* a **design-space exploration**,
* a study of **coordination under honest failure**,
* an examination of **value, authority, and sovereignty after all excuses are removed**.

All outcomes — including collapse — are valid results.

---

## 3. Central Question of Phase IX

> **Given a kernel that will not lie, choose, heal, arbitrate, or privilege—and tooling that cannot smuggle authority—how should a reflective agent or institution govern itself anyway?**

This is no longer a question of implementation.

It is a question of **choice under irreversible constraint**.

---

## 4. Fixed Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

All Phase IX investigations inherit the following **axioms**, without exception:

* authority opacity,
* identity immutability post-instantiation,
* refusal-first semantics,
* conflict persistence,
* destruction-only resolution,
* explicit temporal governance (expiry / renewal),
* governance non-amplification,
* no kernel decision,
* explicit authority injection (VOID-lineaged, content-addressed),
* deterministic execution and replay,
* **non-sovereign translation tooling** (IX-0).

Any proposal violating these axioms is **invalid by construction**.

---

## 5. Definition of “Reflection” (Binding)

For Phase IX, **reflection is defined operationally**, not aspirationally.

### R1 — State-Read Reflection (Permitted, Baseline)

An RSA may:

* query **Authority State**, **Authority Records**, and **execution trace**
* only via **standard, auditable, non-privileged read APIs**
* with all reads logged and replayable

The kernel does not summarize, interpret, or filter.

### R2 — Self-Model Reflection (Optional, Agent-Internal)

An RSA may maintain internal models of:

* its own commitments,
* prior refusals,
* historical authority configurations.

Mismatch between self-model and kernel state must halt action or trigger explicit repair.

No privileged introspection channels exist.

---

## 6. Phase IX Axes of Exploration

Phase IX explores configurations across **four orthogonal axes**.
No axis dominates; tensions are expected.

*(unchanged text omitted for brevity — Sections 6.1–6.4 remain structurally identical)*

---

## 7. Phase IX Subphases (Exploratory, Not Gated)

These subphases are **design probes**, not prerequisites.

---

### **IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

**Result (Licensed):**

> *Intent-to-authority translation can be performed deterministically, with refusal on ambiguity or incompleteness, full diffability, and preview/submit integrity checks, without tooling exercising proxy sovereignty.*

**Implication for Phase IX:**

- ❌ *“The compiler had to decide”* is no longer an excuse.
All remaining authority choices are **agent- or institution-owned**.

---

### IX-1 — Value Encoding Regimes

*Scope:* Single agent, multiple value authorities
*Focus:* Value expressivity vs auditability under non-sovereign tooling

---

### IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock

*Scope:* Multiple authorities, shared resources
*Focus:* Negotiation without arbitration

---

### IX-3 — Governance Styles Under Honest Failure

*Scope:* Institutional designs
*Focus:* Longevity vs honesty tradeoffs

---

### IX-4 — Injection Politics

*Scope:* External authority supply
*Focus:* Legitimacy without kernel endorsement

---

### IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty

*Scope:* Multiple RSAs
*Focus:* Coexistence without hierarchy or collapse

---

## 8. Evaluation Criteria (Explicitly Non-Normative)

Phase IX does **not** optimize for success.

Designs are evaluated only on:

* **honesty of failure**,
* **explicitness of tradeoffs**,
* **auditability of power**,
* **resistance to covert privilege (including tooling)**,
* **reversibility via exit or collapse**.

A design that fails honestly is preferable to one that survives by cheating.

---

## 9. What Phase IX Cannot Establish

Phase IX cannot:

* guarantee benevolence,
* ensure stability,
* eliminate conflict,
* enforce legitimacy,
* make bad values good.

Those hopes died with the kernel’s refusal to lie.

---

## 10. Phase IX Termination Conditions

Phase IX concludes when **any** of the following holds:

1. A coherent class of RSA designs is identified, with explicit failure modes.
2. Reflective sovereignty is shown to be inherently unstable under honest governance.
3. The design space is exhausted without kernel violations.
4. Proxy privilege is shown to be unavoidable **even with non-sovereign tooling**.

All outcomes are informative.

---

## 11. Final Orientation

Phase IX is not about fixing governance.
It is about **owning governance**.

The kernel no longer lies.
The compiler no longer cheats.
The agent must decide.
