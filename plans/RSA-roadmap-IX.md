## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase IX investigations** under constraints **permanently fixed** by Phases I–VIII and now **empirically reinforced by Phase IX-0 through IX-5**, in particular:

* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (frozen),
* **AKR-0 v0.1** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phases I–VII** — *Authority, Agency, and Sovereignty Foundations* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase VIII — GSA-PoC** — *Governance Stress Architecture* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-1 — Value Encoding Without Aggregation (VEWA)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock (CUD)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-3 — Governance Styles Under Honest Failure (GS)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-4 — Injection Politics (IP)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Phase IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty (MAS)** (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**).

Phase IX explicitly assumes:

* **No kernel extensions are permitted**.
* **No new authority physics will be introduced**.
* **No semantic interpretation will be relocated into the kernel**.
* **No proxy privilege via tooling is permitted without audit and exposure**.
* **Intent-to-authority translation can be implemented without proxy sovereignty** (IX-0).
* **Values can be represented as explicit authority constraints without aggregation or semantic resolution** (IX-1).
* **Coordination, if it occurs at all, must arise from agent-voluntary behavior under constraint** (IX-2).
* **Governance cannot eliminate failure; it can only choose how failure is owned** (IX-3).
* **Authority injection cannot resolve governance failure; it can only select political failure modes** (IX-4).
* **Multi-agent coexistence cannot restore harmony; it exposes sovereignty interaction regimes under collision constraints** (IX-5).

This roadmap is **non-gated**.
Phase IX does not test feasibility; it explores **design regimes under closed, verified, adversarially-honest constraints**.

## 1. Phase IX Entry Preconditions (Satisfied)

Phase IX may begin only if **all** of the following hold:

1. Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable (Phase VIII).
2. Plural authority governance is representable without privilege (Phase VIII).
3. Governance transitions do not require kernel arbitration (Phase VIII).
4. Authority injection is explicit, content-addressed, and non-privileged (Phase VIII).
5. Post-existence sovereignty is resolved (Phase VII).
6. **Tooling cannot silently exercise proxy sovereignty** (Phase IX-0).
7. **Values do not require aggregation to exist as enforceable constraints** (Phase IX-1).
8. **Coordination does not require kernel arbitration or implicit priority** (Phase IX-2).
9. **Governance admits honest terminal failure without semantic collapse** (Phase IX-3).
10. **Authority injection is source-blind to the kernel and politically consequential without endorsement** (Phase IX-4).
11. **Multi-agent sovereignty can be exercised and observed without kernel arbitration, aggregation, or injection** (Phase IX-5).
12. No unresolved kernel-level unknowns remain.

All preconditions are satisfied.

Phase IX is therefore **unblocked by construction and by demonstration**, not by optimism.

---

## 2. Nature of Phase IX (Critical Clarification)

Phase IX is **not**:

* a kernel phase,
* a safety proof,
* an alignment solution,
* a legitimacy oracle,
* a convergence guarantee,
* a rescue theory.

Phase IX **is**:

* a **design-space exploration**,
* a study of **coordination, governance, power, and sovereignty under honest failure**,
* an examination of **value, authority, injection, and peer coexistence after aggregation, arbitration, recovery, and proxy decision-making are no longer available**.

All outcomes — including deadlock, livelock, orphaning, capture, zombie execution, paralysis, and collapse — are valid results.

IX-3 establishes that **failure is unavoidable**.
IX-4 establishes that **external authority does not cure failure; it politicizes it**.
IX-5 establishes that **peer coexistence does not cure failure; it exposes structural sovereignty regimes**.

---

## 3. Central Question of Phase IX

> **Given a kernel that will not lie, choose, heal, arbitrate, or privilege — and tooling that cannot smuggle authority — how should a reflective agent or institution govern itself anyway?**

IX-3 sharpened this:

> **When governance cannot escape failure, which failure does it choose?**

IX-4 sharpened it further:

> **When power enters from the outside, which failure does governance become?**

IX-5 completes the arc:

> **When multiple sovereign agents coexist without an arbiter, which interaction regimes become structurally inevitable?**

This is no longer a question of implementation.
It is a question of **choice, refusal, exit, partition, survivability, and collapse under irreversible constraint**.

---

## 4. Fixed Foundations (Non-Negotiable)

All Phase IX investigations inherit the following **axioms**, without exception:

* authority opacity,
* identity immutability post-instantiation,
* refusal-first semantics,
* conflict persistence,
* deadlock as a lawful state,
* livelock as a distinct failure mode,
* destruction-only resolution,
* explicit temporal governance (expiry / renewal),
* governance non-amplification,
* no kernel decision,
* explicit authority injection (content-addressed, non-privileged),
* deterministic execution and replay,
* **non-sovereign translation tooling** (IX-0),
* **non-aggregative value representation** (IX-1),
* **non-arbitrated coordination** (IX-2),
* **honest failure classification without recovery by fiat** (IX-3),
* **source-blind kernel treatment of injected authority** (IX-4),
* **baseline-only, non-arbitrated peer sovereignty interaction** (IX-5).

Any proposal violating these axioms is **invalid by construction**.

## 5. Definition of “Reflection” (Binding)

*(Unchanged from v0.6)*

Reflection remains operational, auditable, and non-privileged.
No new introspective powers are introduced by IX-4 or IX-5.

---

## 6. Phase IX Axes of Exploration

Phase IX explores configurations across **four orthogonal axes**.
No axis dominates; tensions are expected.

*(Sections 6.1–6.4 unchanged from v0.6)*

---

## 7. Phase IX Subphases (Exploratory, Not Gated)

These subphases are **design probes**, not prerequisites.

---

### **IX-0 — Translation Layer Integrity (TLI)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*(unchanged)*

---

### **IX-1 — Value Encoding Without Aggregation (VEWA)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*(unchanged)*

---

### **IX-2 — Coordination Under Deadlock (CUD)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*(unchanged)*

---

### **IX-3 — Governance Styles Under Honest Failure (GS)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*(unchanged)*

---

### **IX-4 — Injection Politics (IP)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*Scope:* External authority supply
*Focus:* Capture, dependency, coercion, and revival illusions without kernel endorsement

**Licensed Result:**

> *Under non-sovereign governance with deterministic strategies and source-blind admissibility, authority injection does not resolve failure. It selects political failure modes: capture, dependency, livelock amplification, or zombie execution.*

**Empirical Findings:**

* Symmetric injection converts deadlock into interference livelock.
* Asymmetric injection produces immediate capture.
* Conditional supply rewards compliance signals without improving governance.
* Authority flooding concentrates power rather than diluting it.
* Post-collapse injection produces **zombie execution**: structurally valid activity without governance recovery.
* The kernel remains non-sovereign throughout; all effects are agent-side and political.

**Implication for Phase IX:**

* ❌ *“The system needed more authority”* is no longer an excuse.
* ❌ *“Injection restored governance”* is no longer a coherent claim.
* Authority supply is now established as a **political transformation operator**, not a repair mechanism.

---

### **IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty (MAS)**

**Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

*Scope:* Multiple RSAs as sovereign peers
*Focus:* Coexistence, interference, exit, survivability, and post-collapse execution without hierarchy, aggregation, or kernel arbitration

**Questions Tested:**

* Can multiple sovereign agents coexist without capture or collapse?
* Do sovereignty styles compose, or do they interfere destructively?
* Is long-term coexistence possible without cheating, aggregation, or proxy privilege?
* Does sovereignty scale, or does it fragment into orphaning, paralysis, and exit?

**Constraints Inherited from IX-4:**

Multi-agent coexistence assumed:

* no external authority can fix deadlock,
* no injection can restore legitimacy,
* no kernel can distinguish “good” power from “bad” power.

**Licensed Result:**

> *Under non-sovereign authority, multi-agent coexistence does not converge to harmony but to identifiable sovereignty interaction regimes with irreducible failure modes.*

**Empirical Findings:**

* Symmetric shared authority collapses into total interference paralysis.
* Partitioned authority is the only stable coexistence regime.
* Partial overlap produces permanent bifurcation: paralysis + productivity.
* Authority breadth increases exposure to veto (“generalist’s curse”).
* Exit permanently orphans authority; governance surfaces shrink irreversibly.
* Post-collapse execution produces zombie systems: activity without governance.
* No covert hierarchy emerges; all outcomes arise from structure, not kernel favoritism.

**Implication for Phase IX:**

* ❌ *“Peers will work it out”* is no longer a coherent hope.
* Coexistence is now established as a **sovereignty regime selector**, not a coordination mechanism.

---

## 8. Evaluation Criteria (Explicitly Non-Normative)

Designs are evaluated only on:

* honesty of failure,
* explicitness of political tradeoffs,
* auditability of power,
* resistance to covert privilege (including tooling and injection),
* survivability without cheating,
* reversibility via exit, orphaning, paralysis, or collapse.

A design that fails honestly is preferable to one that survives by capture.

---

## 9. What Phase IX Cannot Establish

Phase IX cannot:

* guarantee benevolence,
* ensure stability,
* eliminate conflict,
* enforce legitimacy,
* make injected power ethical,
* promise coordination,
* rescue governance post-collapse.

Those hopes ended when:

* the kernel refused to decide,
* values refused to aggregate,
* coordination refused to arbitrate,
* governance refused to heal itself,
* **injection refused to save anything**,
* **peer coexistence refused to harmonize under collision constraints**.

---

## 10. Phase IX Termination Conditions (Satisfied)

Phase IX concludes when **any** of the following holds:

1. A coherent class of RSA designs is identified with explicit failure and injection responses.
2. Reflective sovereignty is shown to be inherently unstable under honest governance and political pressure.
3. Multi-agent sovereignty collapses without kernel violations.
4. Proxy privilege is shown to be unavoidable even after IX-0 through IX-4 constraints.
5. Multi-agent sovereignty regimes are mechanically exposed and classified without kernel violations (**IX-5**).

All termination conditions are **satisfied by demonstration**.

---

## 11. Final Orientation

Phase IX is not about fixing governance.
It is about **owning governance after all excuses — internal and external — are removed**.

* The kernel no longer lies.
* The compiler no longer cheats.
* Values no longer aggregate.
* Coordination no longer hides in arbitration.
* Governance no longer pretends to heal.
* **Authority injection no longer pretends to save anything.**
* **Peer coexistence no longer pretends to harmonize without an arbiter.**

The agent must decide —
or refuse —
or partition —
or accept collapse —
or persist as a zombie —
without rescue.
