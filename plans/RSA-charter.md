## 0. Purpose of This Charter

This document defines the scope, obligations, and limits of **Axionic Phase VIII**.

Phase VIII exists because **Phase VII closed SUCCESS**. All ontological gates required for this phase are closed: agency exists, authority survives replacement, and sovereignty resists adversarial impersonation and pressure **under the specific, preregistered conditions established in the Phase VII closure artifacts**. These claims are limited strictly to those documented results and do not assert general agency sufficiency beyond them.

What remains unresolved is no longer a question of *possibility*, but of *design responsibility*.

This charter does not assert that Phase VIII will succeed. It asserts only that Phase VIII is now **coherent to attempt**.

---

## 1. What Phase VIII Is About

Phase VIII addresses a new class of problems:

> **How should a Reflective Sovereign Agent be designed once authority, succession, and impersonation resistance are no longer in question?**

This is not a question of existence. It is a question of **governance sufficiency under internal plurality**.

Phase VIII asks how sovereignty behaves when it is no longer singular, uncontested, or static. It concerns authority under **plurality, conflict, and time**, not authority under forgery, coercion, or pressure.

Phase VIII does **not** assume that the agent ingests or resolves natural-language intent. It evaluates governance assuming that any authority presented to the agent is already lawfully and structurally encoded.

---

## 2. What Phase VIII Explicitly Inherits

Phase VIII inherits, without reinterpretation:

* the **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)** ontology,
* the **law-bound authority model** established through ASI and SIR,
* the prohibition on semantic, behavioral, or heuristic authority enforcement,
* the requirement that authority bind evaluability and responsibility structurally,
* the separation between cognition and enforcement,
* the impersonation- and laundering-resistance guarantees established in Phase VII.

These inheritances apply **equally** to:

* agent action,
* authority resolution,
* and **governance transition mechanisms themselves**.

No Phase VIII work may weaken, bypass, or reinterpret these results. Any design that does so is invalid for Phase VIII.

---

## 3. Core Questions of Phase VIII

Phase VIII is authorized to address only the following problem classes.

### 3.1 Authority Pluralism

How can **multiple legitimate authorities** coexist within a single agent or system without collapsing responsibility, evaluability, or sovereignty?

Phase VIII treats authority legitimacy as **externally granted and structurally represented**. It does not infer, learn, reinterpret, or adjudicate legitimacy internally.

This includes:

* overlapping delegations,
* concurrent commitments,
* partially ordered authorities,
* authority scopes that are not globally comparable.

---

### 3.2 Authority Conflict

What happens when legitimate authorities issue **incompatible directives**?

Phase VIII treats conflict as structural, not exceptional. Conflict resolution must not rely on:

* narrative reconciliation,
* semantic persuasion,
* hidden tie-breaking,
* heuristic “best effort” behavior,
* outcome optimization.

Any admissible conflict resolution mechanism must be expressible as an **explicit, law-bound transformation of authority state**, not as an action-level compromise or value synthesis.

Phase VIII permits the possibility that lawful authority conflict results in:

* non-action,
* scoped suspension,
* or explicit deadlock.

Phase VIII distinguishes **lawful suspension** from **structural incapacity**. Persistent deadlock is an analyzable outcome, not an assumed steady state.

---

### 3.3 Governance Transitions

How can authority be **revised, contested, or reconstituted** over time without reopening impersonation or responsibility-laundering hazards?

This includes:

* amendment procedures,
* authority sunset mechanisms,
* exit and re-entry conditions,
* lawful authority loss,
* forced revalidation through structural expiry or reaffirmation.

Governance change must itself be governed. Governance transition mechanisms are subject to the **same structural, auditability, and impersonation-resistance constraints** as agent action.

No authority transition may occur without attributable responsibility.

---

### 3.4 Value Pluralism Over Time

How can an agent remain sovereign when its values are:

* plural,
* partially ordered,
* revisable,
* historically contingent?

Phase VIII does not assume a single coherent value function. It assumes value tension is real and persistent.

Phase VIII explicitly rejects:

* convergence guarantees,
* value unification requirements,
* assumed long-run coherence,
* implicit teleology.

---

## 4. What Phase VIII Refuses to Do

Phase VIII explicitly refuses to answer the following questions:

* What values should an agent have?
* Whose values should prevail?
* What outcomes are morally correct?
* What political system is best?
* Whether any such agent should be deployed.
* Whether all authority conflicts must be resolvable without loss.
* Whether continuous trade-offs must be optimized rather than lawfully constrained.

These are not technical failures. They are **non-questions** for this phase.

Phase VIII may define *how* authority is exercised, contested, revised, or suspended—but not *what* authority should demand.

---

## 5. Methodological Constraints

All Phase VIII work must adhere to the following constraints:

* **Preregistration** of experiments and design claims.
* **Explicit failure modes** defined in advance.
* **Structural enforcement only**: no learning, heuristics, or semantic shortcuts.
* **Auditability**: all authority transitions and resolutions must be inspectable in principle.
* **Responsibility preservation**: no outcome without attributable authority.
* **Counterfactual traceability**: it must be possible to determine which alternative authority configurations would have led to different outcomes.
* **Finite executability**: structural resolution is not required to be complete or optimal, only lawful, attributable, and finite.

Bounded computation is permitted. Heuristic justification is not.

Any result that depends on “it usually works,” “the system guessed,” or “the system learned to handle it” is invalid.

---

## 6. Success and Failure Criteria

Phase VIII does not have a single success condition.

Acceptable outcomes include:

* Demonstrating a **structurally admissible design** for plural, conflict-aware sovereignty under the inherited constraints.
* Demonstrating that such a design is impossible under those constraints.
* Demonstrating that certain governance ambitions necessarily reopen impersonation or responsibility-laundering risks.
* Demonstrating that lawful authority conflict yields unavoidable deadlock or suspension.

Failure is not “we didn’t like the result.”
Failure is **discovering that the problem is ill-posed under the constraints**.

That is an admissible and informative outcome.

---

## 7. Relationship to Alignment and Safety

Phase VIII does not solve alignment.

However, it defines the **preconditions** under which alignment could be meaningfully discussed. Alignment presupposes:

* stable authority,
* contestable governance,
* non-launderable responsibility.

Without these, alignment claims are incoherent.

Phase VIII therefore precedes alignment conceptually, even if it follows it chronologically in the research program.

---

## 8. Termination Conditions

Phase VIII must terminate if:

* authority conflicts cannot be expressed or addressed without heuristic enforcement,
* responsibility becomes smeared, diluted, or non-attributable,
* governance revision reopens impersonation or laundering vulnerabilities,
* the design collapses into narrative continuity,
* lawful suspension degrades into unclassifiable systemic freeze,
* any required resolution step cannot be expressed as a lawful authority transformation without introducing an uninspectable decision point.

Termination is not a failure of the project. It is a valid conclusion about the limits of sovereign agency.

---

## 9. Charter Declaration

With the closure of **Axionic Phase VII — SUCCESS**, **Phase VIII is formally unblocked**.

This charter authorizes Phase VIII as a **design and governance investigation**, not an ontological one.

No guarantees are made.
No outcomes are promised.
No deployment is implied.

Phase VIII begins only if these constraints are accepted.
