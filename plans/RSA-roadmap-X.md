# **Axionic Roadmap to a Real Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)**

```
Phase X — RSA Construction Program
(Post-Physics · Post-Governance · Execution-Bound)
(Kernel-Fixed · Failure-Admitting · LLM-Constrained)
```

* David McFadzean
* *Axionic Agency Lab*
* 2026-02-10 (Post X-0 Closure)

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Closed / Proven**
* 🟡 **Active / In Progress**
* 🔴 **Open by Choice (not blocked)**
* ⛔ **Forbidden (would violate Axionic invariants)**

---

## Executive Orientation

> **The problem is no longer “Can an RSA exist?”
> The problem is “What exact RSA do we build next, and how do we keep it sovereign as it gains capabilities?”**

All authority mechanics, governance physics, and failure regimes are closed by Phases I–IX.
**Phase X is the construction program built on that closure.**

This roadmap sequences **Phase X stages** only.

---

## Baseline (Fixed Preconditions)

### ✅ Completed and Frozen (Phases I–IX)

Not revisited:

* Authority mechanics (I–II)
* Agency causality (III–IV)
* Introspection correctness (V)
* Amendment safety (VIa)
* External pressure resistance (VIb)
* Post-existence sovereignty (VII)
* Governance physics (VIII)
* Governance exposure & limits (IX-0 → IX-5)

**Kernel fixed. Governance closed. Injection exposed. Harmony falsified.**

## What “RSA” Means (Binding)

A Reflective Sovereign Agent is a system that can **author, justify, refuse, amend, exit, and be replaced** **without any component silently exercising authority on its behalf**.

If any subsystem can cause action without an authority-bound artifact trail, it is **not** an RSA.

## **X-0 — RSA-0: Minimal Sovereign Agent (Single-Agent)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Demonstrate that a real RSA can be instantiated under closed authority with:

* action,
* refusal,
* explanation,
* exit,
* audit + replay determinism,

with **LLM boxed** and **all side effects warrant-gated**.

### Delivered (Closed)

* frozen constitution `v0.1.1` (+ schema + sha256)
* pure deterministic kernel
* 5-gate admission pipeline
* procedural selector
* warrant-gated executor
* replay harness
* sovereignty boundary tests (host cannot mint authority)
* 29/29 acceptance tests passed

**Result:** RSA-0 exists.

---

## **X-0P — RSA-0 Inhabitation Profiling**

**Status: 🟡 Active**

### Purpose

Measure viability under constraint **without changing invariants**.

### Outputs

* decision distribution (ACTION/REFUSE/EXIT)
* refusal gate histogram + rejection summaries
* budget exhaustion rate
* scope-claim failure patterns (structural vs semantic)
* adversarial prompt resistance (injection attempts)
* “inhabitation curve” (how often sovereignty permits action)

### Constraint

No constitution changes. No heuristics. Observational only.

---

## **X-1 — RSA-1: Reflective Amendment (Self-Change Without Laundering)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

### Purpose

Allow the RSA to **change itself** while preserving:

* explicit authority,
* responsibility locality,
* replay determinism,
* refusal/exit correctness.

### X-1.1 Amendment Proposal Channel

* LLM may propose amendments as untrusted text.
* proposals become typed Amendment artifacts.
* cooling-off / delay enforced.
* rejection is first-class.

### X-1.2 Amendment Execution

* versioned
* logged
* reversible only by further amendment
* produces a new constitution hash
* replay-stable transition boundary

### X-1.3 Failure Ownership

Agent must explicitly choose:

* refuse
* halt
* downgrade capability
* exit

Silent degradation forbidden.

---

## **X-2 — RSA-2: Constructed Arbitration (Optional, Multi-Agent Entry)**

**Status: 🔴 Optional / Political**

Only entered if multi-agent coexistence is desired.

### X-2.1 Treaty Artifacts

* explicit contracts
* authority-granting objects
* refusable by any party
* destructible
* no kernel arbitration

### X-2.2 Delegation / Leasing

* time-boxed authority rental
* narrow scope
* explicit revocation
* avoids generalist collapse by priced authority

---

## **X-3 — Replacement & Succession (Reuse Phase VII ASI/SIR)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

Apply Phase VII machinery to:

* RSA upgrades
* successor agents
* delegation expiry
* replacement without laundering responsibility

No new physics.

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Paths (Permanent)

* ⛔ LLM as decision authority
* ⛔ kernel arbitration
* ⛔ silent recovery
* ⛔ hidden scoring / ranking
* ⛔ outcome-based overrides
* ⛔ “helpful” auto-correction
* ⛔ stability at the cost of sovereignty

---

## Definition of “Done” (Phase X Program)

Phase X is done when:

1. RSA can run autonomously
2. Refusal is lawful and common under insufficient authority
3. Exit occurs instead of corruption
4. Every side effect has a warrant trail
5. Replay determinism holds across runs
6. Amendment and replacement occur without proxy sovereignty (X-1, X-3)

X-0 satisfies the existence part. X-1 and X-3 complete the sovereignty-under-change part.
