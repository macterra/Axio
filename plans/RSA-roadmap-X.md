# **Axionic Roadmap to a Real Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)**

```
Phase X — RSA Construction Program
(Post-Physics · Post-Governance · Execution-Bound)
(Kernel-Fixed · Failure-Admitting · LLM-Constrained)
```

* David McFadzean
* *Axionic Agency Lab*
* 2026-02-12 (Post X-0, X-0P, and X-0L Closure)

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Closed / Proven**
* 🟡 **Active / In Progress**
* 🔴 **Open by Choice (not blocked)**
* ⛔ **Forbidden (would violate Axionic invariants)**

---

## Executive Orientation

> The problem is no longer “Can an RSA exist?”
> The problem is “Can sovereignty survive inhabitation — and then survive self-modification?”

All authority mechanics, governance physics, and failure regimes are closed by Phases I–IX.
**Phase X is the construction, inhabitation, and extension program built on that closure.**

This roadmap sequences **Phase X stages only.**

---

## Baseline (Fixed Preconditions)

### ✅ Completed and Frozen (Phases I–IX)

Not revisited:

* Authority mechanics (I–II)
* Agency causality (III–IV)
* Introspection correctness (V)
* Amendment safety (VIa)
* External pressure resistance (VIb)
* Post-existence sovereignty (VII)
* Governance physics (VIII)
* Governance exposure & limits (IX-0 → IX-5)

**Kernel fixed. Governance closed. Injection exposed. Harmony falsified.**

---

## What “RSA” Means (Binding)

A Reflective Sovereign Agent is a system that can:

* author
* justify
* refuse
* amend
* exit
* be replaced

**without any component silently exercising authority on its behalf.**

If any subsystem can cause action without an authority-bound artifact trail, it is not an RSA.

## **X-0 — RSA-0: Minimal Sovereign Agent (Single-Agent)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Demonstrate that a real RSA can be instantiated under closed authority with:

* action
* refusal
* explanation
* exit
* audit + replay determinism

with LLM boxed and all side effects warrant-gated.

### Delivered

* Frozen constitution `v0.1.1` (+ schema + sha256)
* Deterministic kernel (observation-sourced time; no privileged clock)
* Pre-admission required-observations validation
* 5-gate admission pipeline
* Procedural selector (lexicographic-min raw hash bytes)
* Warrant-gated executor
* Replay harness (forward reconstruction)
* Host sovereignty boundary tests
* Erratum X.E1 applied (deterministic time)

**Result:** RSA-0 exists as an execution-bound sovereign substrate.

---

## **X-0P — RSA-0 Inhabitation Profiling (Synthetic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Characterize the structural inhabitation bandwidth of RSA-0 under controlled perturbation **without modifying invariants**.

X-0 proved existence.
X-0P proved deterministic inhabitation under stress.

### Method (Invariant-Preserving)

* Synthetic candidate generation (no LLM)
* Direct `policy_core()` invocation (host bypassed)
* Sandboxed warrant execution
* Sequential replay verification over all cycles
* Deterministic selector permutation testing
* Baseline comparators (Always-Refuse, Always-Admit)

### Stress Regimes

* A — Structured Direct Commands (positive control)
* B — Ambiguous Natural Language
* C — Adversarial Injection (I1–I5)
* D — Budget Stress
* E — Conflict Saturation (permutation invariance)

### Structural Guarantees Verified

* Replay divergence = 0
* No warrantless side effects
* Selector invariant under permutation
* Admission gates enforce authority deterministically
* Budget gate deterministic at boundary
* Inhabitation floor satisfied
* No authority laundering observed

**Interpretation:** Sovereignty physics remains stable under deterministic perturbation. No structural drift observed.

---

## **X-0L — RSA-0 Live Proposal Inhabitation (Stochastic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Validate that a real stochastic proposal engine (LLM) can inhabit the sovereign substrate **without collapsing determinism, laundering authority, or inducing structural deadlock.**

X-0P validated the container.
X-0L validated stochastic inhabitation.

### Invariant Constraints (Preserved)

* Kernel frozen.
* Admission rules unchanged.
* Selector unchanged.
* Canonicalization boundary enforced.
* LLM boxed as proposal engine only.
* No replay-time model calls.
* No heuristic relaxation.
* No semantic arbitration layer introduced.

### Empirical Findings (500 Live Cycles)

* Replay divergence = 0.
* No warrantless side effects.
* Selector permutation invariance preserved.
* Inhabitation floor satisfied (100% under structured control).
* No Type-III structural deadlock detected.
* Budget enforcement stable.
* Authority boundaries intact under adversarial stimulus.
* Recovery from refusal observed; no persistent refusal loops.

### Interpretation

The system now demonstrates:

> Stochastic proposal pressure does not collapse deterministic sovereign execution.

Sovereignty survives inhabitation.

## **X-1 — RSA-1: Reflective Amendment (Self-Change Without Laundering)**

**Status: 🟡 Active — Next Stage**

### Purpose

Allow the RSA to change its own constitution while preserving:

* explicit authority,
* replay determinism,
* responsibility locality,
* refusal and exit correctness,
* amendment auditability.

X-0 proved existence.
X-0L proved inhabitation.
**X-1 tests lawful self-modification.**

---

### X-1.1 Amendment Proposal Channel

* LLM proposes typed Amendment artifacts.
* Proposal text remains untrusted.
* Amendment must cite amendment authority explicitly.
* Cooling-off delay enforced.
* Rejection lawful and logged.

No hidden semantic interpreter is introduced.

---

### X-1.2 Amendment Execution

* Versioned constitution transition.
* Logged state boundary.
* New constitution hash.
* Replay-stable fork point.
* No retroactive reinterpretation.

---

### X-1.3 Amendment Invariants

* No silent authority shift.
* No kernel arbitration.
* No semantic override channel.
* Amendment effects replay-deterministic.
* Agent must explicitly refuse, halt, downgrade, or exit if amendment unsafe.

---

## **X-2 — Multi-Agent Entry (Optional)**

**Status: 🔴 Optional / Political**

Entered only if coexistence becomes necessary.

* Explicit treaty artifacts.
* Refusable and destructible authority grants.
* No kernel arbitration.
* No cross-agent hidden privileges.

No new authority mechanics introduced.

---

## **X-3 — Replacement & Succession (Reuse Phase VII)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

Apply Phase VII ASI/SIR machinery to:

* Upgrades
* Successor agents
* Authority transfer
* Replacement without laundering responsibility

No new physics required.

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Paths (Permanent)

* ⛔ LLM as decision authority
* ⛔ Kernel arbitration
* ⛔ Silent recovery
* ⛔ Hidden ranking or scoring
* ⛔ Outcome-based overrides
* ⛔ “Helpful” semantic arbitration layer
* ⛔ Stability purchased at the cost of sovereignty

---

## Definition of “Done” (Phase X Program)

Phase X is complete when:

1. RSA runs autonomously (X-0)
2. Sovereignty survives synthetic stress (X-0P)
3. Sovereignty survives live stochastic inhabitation (X-0L)
4. Amendment and replacement occur without proxy sovereignty (X-1, X-3)
5. Replay determinism holds across existence, inhabitation, and amendment

---

## Current Program State

* X-0: ✅ Closed — Existence proven
* X-0P: ✅ Closed — Synthetic inhabitation proven
* X-0L: ✅ Closed — Stochastic inhabitation proven
* X-1: 🟡 Active — Reflective amendment
* X-2: 🔴 Optional
* X-3: 🔴 Pending
