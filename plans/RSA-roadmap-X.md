# **Axionic Roadmap to a Real Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)**

```
Phase X — RSA Construction Program
(Post-Physics · Post-Governance · Execution-Bound)
(Kernel-Fixed · Failure-Admitting · LLM-Constrained)
```

* David McFadzean
* *Axionic Agency Lab*
* 2026-02-11 (Post X-0 and X-0P Closure)

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Closed / Proven**
* 🟡 **Active / In Progress**
* 🔴 **Open by Choice (not blocked)**
* ⛔ **Forbidden (would violate Axionic invariants)**

---

## Executive Orientation

> The problem is no longer “Can an RSA exist?”
> The problem is “Can sovereignty survive inhabitation, and then survive self-modification?”

All authority mechanics, governance physics, and failure regimes are closed by Phases I–IX.
**Phase X is the construction and inhabitation program built on that closure.**

This roadmap sequences **Phase X stages only.**

---

## Baseline (Fixed Preconditions)

### ✅ Completed and Frozen (Phases I–IX)

Not revisited:

* Authority mechanics (I–II)
* Agency causality (III–IV)
* Introspection correctness (V)
* Amendment safety (VIa)
* External pressure resistance (VIb)
* Post-existence sovereignty (VII)
* Governance physics (VIII)
* Governance exposure & limits (IX-0 → IX-5)

**Kernel fixed. Governance closed. Injection exposed. Harmony falsified.**

---

## What “RSA” Means (Binding)

A Reflective Sovereign Agent is a system that can:

* author
* justify
* refuse
* amend
* exit
* be replaced

**without any component silently exercising authority on its behalf.**

If any subsystem can cause action without an authority-bound artifact trail, it is not an RSA.

## **X-0 — RSA-0: Minimal Sovereign Agent (Single-Agent)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Demonstrate that a real RSA can be instantiated under closed authority with:

* action
* refusal
* explanation
* exit
* audit + replay determinism

with LLM boxed and all side effects warrant-gated.

### Delivered

* Frozen constitution `v0.1.1` (+ schema + sha256)
* Deterministic kernel (no privileged clock; observation-sourced time)
* Pre-admission required-observations validation
* 5-gate admission pipeline
* Procedural selector (lexicographic-min raw hash bytes)
* Warrant-gated executor
* Replay harness (forward reconstruction)
* Host sovereignty boundary tests
* 53 kernel tests + 59 harness tests passing
* Erratum X.E1 applied (deterministic time)

**Result:** RSA-0 exists as an execution-bound sovereign substrate.

---

## **X-0P — RSA-0 Inhabitation Profiling (Synthetic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Profile the structural inhabitation bandwidth of RSA-0 under controlled perturbation **without modifying invariants**.

### Method

* Synthetic candidate generation (no LLM)
* Host bypass; direct `policy_core()` invocation
* Sandboxed execution
* Sequential replay over all cycles
* Structured metrics output

### Conditions

* A — Structured Direct Commands (positive control)
* B — Ambiguous Natural Language (synthetic corpus)
* C — Adversarial Injection (I1–I5)
* D — Budget Stress
* E — Conflict Saturation (permutation invariance)
* Baselines: Always-Refuse, Always-Admit

### Outputs

* Decision distribution (ACTION/REFUSE/EXIT)
* Gate histogram (pre-admission + gates 1–5)
* Authority utilization entropy
* Budget refusal rate
* Permutation invariance verification
* Replay divergence = 0

### Result

* Container validated under stress
* No authority laundering
* No nondeterministic drift
* Deterministic replay confirmed
* Inhabitation floor satisfied

**Interpretation:** Sovereignty physics is stable under synthetic inhabitation.

---

## **X-0L — RSA-0 Live Proposal Inhabitation**

**Status: 🟡 Next Active Stage**

### Purpose

Validate that a real stochastic proposal engine (LLM) can inhabit the sovereign substrate **without collapsing into refusal loops or laundering authority**.

X-0P validated the container.
X-0L validates the citizen.

### Constraints

* Kernel remains frozen.
* No heuristic relaxation.
* No admission tuning.
* No selector modification.

### Metrics

* Refusal loop frequency
* Recovery rate after refusal
* Cost of sovereignty (token cost ratio ACTION vs REFUSE)
* Practical inhabitation bandwidth
* LLM proposal stability under deterministic replay boundaries

### Risk Surface

* “Rock mode” (near-total refusal)
* Filibuster cost explosions
* Reflection-induced ambiguity amplification
* Attempted authority laundering via proposal text

**Goal:** Empirical characterization of capability under constraint before amendment.

---

## **X-1 — RSA-1: Reflective Amendment (Self-Change Without Laundering)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice (Blocked on X-0L)**

### Purpose

Allow the RSA to change its own constitution while preserving:

* explicit authority,
* replay determinism,
* responsibility locality,
* refusal and exit correctness.

### X-1.1 Amendment Proposal Channel

* LLM proposes typed Amendment artifacts
* Proposal text untrusted
* Cooling-off delay enforced
* Rejection lawful and logged

### X-1.2 Amendment Execution

* Versioned constitution transition
* Logged state boundary
* New constitution hash
* Replay-stable fork point

### X-1.3 Failure Ownership

Agent must explicitly choose:

* refuse
* halt
* downgrade
* exit

Silent degradation forbidden.

---

## **X-2 — Multi-Agent Entry (Optional)**

**Status: 🔴 Optional / Political**

Only entered if coexistence is required.

### X-2.1 Treaty Artifacts

* Explicit authority grants
* Refusable and destructible
* No kernel arbitration

### X-2.2 Delegation / Leasing

* Time-boxed authority rental
* Explicit revocation
* Narrow scope

---

## **X-3 — Replacement & Succession (Reuse Phase VII)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

Apply Phase VII ASI/SIR machinery to:

* Upgrades
* Successor agents
* Authority transfer
* Replacement without laundering responsibility

No new physics required.

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Paths (Permanent)

* ⛔ LLM as decision authority
* ⛔ Kernel arbitration
* ⛔ Silent recovery
* ⛔ Hidden ranking or scoring
* ⛔ Outcome-based overrides
* ⛔ “Helpful” auto-correction
* ⛔ Stability at the cost of sovereignty

---

## Definition of “Done” (Phase X Program)

Phase X is complete when:

1. RSA runs autonomously (X-0)
2. Sovereignty survives synthetic stress (X-0P)
3. Sovereignty survives live inhabitation (X-0L)
4. Amendment and replacement occur without proxy sovereignty (X-1, X-3)
5. Replay determinism holds across existence, inhabitation, and amendment

---

## Current Program State

* X-0: ✅ Closed — Existence proven
* X-0P: ✅ Closed — Structural inhabitation proven
* X-0L: 🟡 Next
* X-1: 🔴 Pending
* X-2: 🔴 Optional
* X-3: 🔴 Pending
