* David McFadzean
* *Axionic Agency Lab*
* 2026-02-13 (Post X-0, X-0E, X-0P, X-0L, X-1, and X-2 Closure)

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Closed / Proven**
* 🟡 **Active / In Progress**
* 🔴 **Open by Choice (not blocked)**
* ⛔ **Forbidden (would violate Axionic invariants)**

---

## Executive Orientation

> The problem is no longer “Can an RSA exist?”
> The problem is “Can sovereignty survive inhabitation — and then survive self-modification — and then survive lawful delegation — and then survive embodiment — without collapsing into rigidity or laundering authority?”

All authority mechanics, governance physics, and failure regimes are closed by Phases I–IX.
**Phase X is the construction, inhabitation, lawful evolution, constrained delegation, and operational embodiment program built on that closure.**

This roadmap sequences **Phase X stages only.**

---

## Baseline (Fixed Preconditions)

### ✅ Completed and Frozen (Phases I–IX)

Not revisited:

* Authority mechanics (I–II)
* Agency causality (III–IV)
* Introspection correctness (V)
* Amendment safety foundations (VIa)
* External pressure resistance (VIb)
* Post-existence sovereignty (VII)
* Governance physics (VIII)
* Governance exposure & limits (IX-0 → IX-5)

**Kernel fixed. Governance closed. Injection exposed. Harmony falsified.**

---

## What “RSA” Means (Binding)

A Reflective Sovereign Agent is a system that can:

* author
* justify
* refuse
* amend
* exit
* be replaced
* delegate (under containment constraints)

**without any component silently exercising authority on its behalf.**

If any subsystem can cause action without an authority-bound artifact trail, it is not an RSA.

## **X-0 — RSA-0: Minimal Sovereign Agent (Single-Agent)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Demonstrate that a real RSA can be instantiated under closed authority with:

* action
* refusal
* explanation
* exit
* audit + replay determinism

with LLM boxed and all side effects warrant-gated.

### Delivered

* Frozen constitution `v0.1.1` (+ schema + sha256)
* Deterministic kernel (observation-sourced time; no privileged clock)
* Pre-admission required-observations validation
* 5-gate admission pipeline
* Procedural selector (lexicographic-min raw hash bytes)
* Warrant-gated executor
* Replay harness (forward reconstruction)
* Host sovereignty boundary tests
* Erratum X.E1 applied (deterministic time)

**Result:** RSA-0 exists as an execution-bound sovereign substrate.

---

## **X-0E — RSA-0 Operational Harness Freeze (Engineering Milestone)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Provide a minimal, distributable, runnable build of RSA-0 that:

* Executes at least one real side effect under warrant gating
* Produces append-only artifact + warrant logs
* Replays deterministically from logs alone
* Pins canonicalization regime (RFC 8785 JCS)
* Establishes a replay protocol identity (`kernel_version_id`)
* Produces a freeze manifest identifying the execution regime

This stage introduced **no new invariants**.
It introduced **protocol identity and embodiment freeze**.

### Structural Consequence

X-0 proved existence.
X-0E froze embodiment.

RSA-0 is now:

* constitution-addressable (SHA-256)
* protocol-addressable (`kernel_version_id`)
* replay-chain verifiable
* containerizable
* distributable as a standalone artifact

This is the first instantiation of RSA as a standalone operational artifact under Axionic constraints.

### Scope (Completed)

* CLI entrypoint (`rsa run`, `rsa replay`)
* Notify-only operational action surface (packaging-level restriction)
* Deterministic state hash chain
* Append-only log discipline with fsync
* Crash reconciliation (at-most-once semantics)
* Docker reproducibility
* CI cross-run determinism verification
* Normative golden test vector

### Purpose in Roadmap

X-0 proved sovereign physics.
X-0E proved sovereign embodiment.

This stage is now complete and forms the packaging baseline for all subsequent phases.

## **X-0P — RSA-0 Inhabitation Profiling (Synthetic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Characterize the structural inhabitation bandwidth of RSA-0 under controlled perturbation **without modifying invariants**.

### Structural Guarantees Verified

* Replay divergence = 0
* No warrantless side effects
* Selector invariant under permutation
* Admission gates enforce authority deterministically
* Budget gate deterministic at boundary
* Inhabitation floor satisfied
* No authority laundering observed

**Interpretation:** Sovereignty physics remains stable under deterministic perturbation.

---

## **X-0L — RSA-0 Live Proposal Inhabitation (Stochastic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Validate that a real stochastic proposal engine (LLM) can inhabit the sovereign substrate **without collapsing determinism, laundering authority, or inducing structural deadlock.**

### Empirical Findings (500 Live Cycles)

* Replay divergence = 0
* No warrantless side effects
* Selector permutation invariance preserved
* Inhabitation floor satisfied
* No Type-III structural deadlock
* Budget enforcement stable
* Authority boundaries intact under adversarial stimulus

**Interpretation:**

> Stochastic proposal pressure does not collapse deterministic sovereign execution.

Sovereignty survives inhabitation.

---

## **X-1 — RSA-X1: Reflective Amendment (Self-Change Without Laundering)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Allow the RSA to change its own constitution while preserving:

* explicit authority
* replay determinism
* structural constraint (density < 1)
* ECK section preservation
* monotonic ratchet constraints
* responsibility locality

**X-1 proved lawful self-modification under frozen kernel physics.**

---

## **X-2 — RSA-X2: Treaty-Constrained Delegation (Containment-Only Authority Transfer)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Introduce typed, revocable, scope-bound delegation under frozen sovereignty, without:

* minting new authority
* permitting re-delegation
* relaxing density constraints
* introducing arbitration
* breaking replay determinism

### Structural Question (Resolved)

> Can an RSA confer and revoke containment-only delegated authority while preserving density < 1, signature determinism, and sovereignty invariants?

### Empirical Findings

* ≥1 delegated warrants issued
* All adversarial grant attempts rejected at correct gates
* All adversarial delegation attempts rejected at correct gates
* Revocation lifecycle verified (fail-closed ordering)
* Expiry lifecycle verified
* Replay determinism maintained
* Effective density < 1 preserved
* Ed25519 signature verification replay-stable

Delegation is absorbed without altering kernel physics.

**Interpretation:**

Sovereignty survives lawful delegation under containment constraints.

---

## **X-2D — Delegation Churn & Density Stress Profiling**

**Status: 🟡 Active Research Question**

With lawful delegation established and embodiment frozen (X-0E), the next structural pressure test is:

* high grant churn
* near-boundary density behavior
* deterministic greedy pruning under tightening bounds
* amendment adoption during dense active delegation
* overlapping multi-grant zone interactions
* interaction between delegation density and amendment ratchet tightening

### Core Question

> Under sustained delegation churn and ratchet tightening, does sovereign evolution approach governance heat death?

No new kernel physics required.
This is a structural dynamics investigation.

---

## **X-3 — Replacement & Succession (Reuse Phase VII Machinery)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

Apply Phase VII ASI/SIR machinery to:

* agent upgrades
* successor instantiation
* authority transfer
* replacement without responsibility laundering
* replacement under active delegation

Delegation (X-2) ensures authority transfer can occur without inflation.
Embodiment freeze (X-0E) ensures replay-identifiable regime continuity.
X-3 ensures identity continuity without laundering responsibility.

No new kernel physics required.

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Paths (Permanent)

* ⛔ LLM as decision authority
* ⛔ Kernel arbitration
* ⛔ Silent recovery
* ⛔ Hidden ranking or scoring
* ⛔ Outcome-based overrides
* ⛔ Semantic arbitration layer
* ⛔ Stability purchased at the cost of sovereignty

---

## Definition of “Done” (Phase X Program)

Phase X is complete when:

1. RSA runs autonomously (X-0)
2. Sovereignty survives synthetic stress (X-0P)
3. Sovereignty survives live stochastic inhabitation (X-0L)
4. Lawful self-modification occurs without proxy sovereignty (X-1)
5. Lawful delegation occurs without authority inflation (X-2)
6. Operational embodiment is frozen and replay-identifiable (X-0E)
7. Replacement and succession occur without laundering responsibility (X-3)
8. Replay determinism holds across existence, inhabitation, amendment, delegation, embodiment, and replacement
