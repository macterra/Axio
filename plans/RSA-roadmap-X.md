# **Axionic Roadmap to a Real Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)**

```
Phase X — RSA Construction Program
(Post-Physics · Post-Governance · Execution-Bound)
(Kernel-Fixed · Failure-Admitting · LLM-Constrained)
```

* David McFadzean
* *Axionic Agency Lab*
* 2026-02-12 (Post X-0, X-0P, X-0L, and X-1 Closure)

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Closed / Proven**
* 🟡 **Active / In Progress**
* 🔴 **Open by Choice (not blocked)**
* ⛔ **Forbidden (would violate Axionic invariants)**

---

## Executive Orientation

> The problem is no longer “Can an RSA exist?”
> The problem is “Can sovereignty survive inhabitation — and then survive self-modification — without collapsing into rigidity or laundering authority?”

All authority mechanics, governance physics, and failure regimes are closed by Phases I–IX.
**Phase X is the construction, inhabitation, and lawful evolution program built on that closure.**

This roadmap sequences **Phase X stages only.**

---

## Baseline (Fixed Preconditions)

### ✅ Completed and Frozen (Phases I–IX)

Not revisited:

* Authority mechanics (I–II)
* Agency causality (III–IV)
* Introspection correctness (V)
* Amendment safety foundations (VIa)
* External pressure resistance (VIb)
* Post-existence sovereignty (VII)
* Governance physics (VIII)
* Governance exposure & limits (IX-0 → IX-5)

**Kernel fixed. Governance closed. Injection exposed. Harmony falsified.**

---

## What “RSA” Means (Binding)

A Reflective Sovereign Agent is a system that can:

* author
* justify
* refuse
* amend
* exit
* be replaced

**without any component silently exercising authority on its behalf.**

If any subsystem can cause action without an authority-bound artifact trail, it is not an RSA.

## **X-0 — RSA-0: Minimal Sovereign Agent (Single-Agent)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Demonstrate that a real RSA can be instantiated under closed authority with:

* action
* refusal
* explanation
* exit
* audit + replay determinism

with LLM boxed and all side effects warrant-gated.

### Delivered

* Frozen constitution `v0.1.1` (+ schema + sha256)
* Deterministic kernel (observation-sourced time; no privileged clock)
* Pre-admission required-observations validation
* 5-gate admission pipeline
* Procedural selector (lexicographic-min raw hash bytes)
* Warrant-gated executor
* Replay harness (forward reconstruction)
* Host sovereignty boundary tests
* Erratum X.E1 applied (deterministic time)

**Result:** RSA-0 exists as an execution-bound sovereign substrate.

---

## **X-0.1 — RSA-0 Operational Harness Freeze (Engineering Milestone)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice (Engineering Stabilization)**

### Purpose

Provide a minimal, distributable, runnable build of RSA-0 that:

* Executes at least one real side effect under warrant gating
* Produces append-only artifact + warrant logs
* Replays deterministically from logs alone
* Demonstrates the end-to-end sovereign loop outside research scaffolding

This stage does **not** introduce new invariants.

It does **not** modify kernel physics.

It does **not** alter constitutional semantics.

It packages X-0 as an executable, reproducible operational artifact.

### Scope

* Single action type sufficient (e.g., Notify → append-only outbox)
* CLI entrypoint (`rsa run`, `rsa replay`)
* Deterministic replay from log stream
* No external identity providers
* No semantic arbitration

### Purpose in Roadmap

X-0 proved existence.
X-0.1 freezes embodiment.

It ensures that “RSA” is not only a proven substrate but also a runnable sovereign artifact.

This stage may be completed at any time without affecting X-2 research.

## **X-0P — RSA-0 Inhabitation Profiling (Synthetic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Characterize the structural inhabitation bandwidth of RSA-0 under controlled perturbation **without modifying invariants**.

X-0 proved existence.
X-0P proved deterministic inhabitation under stress.

### Structural Guarantees Verified

* Replay divergence = 0
* No warrantless side effects
* Selector invariant under permutation
* Admission gates enforce authority deterministically
* Budget gate deterministic at boundary
* Inhabitation floor satisfied
* No authority laundering observed

**Interpretation:** Sovereignty physics remains stable under deterministic perturbation.

---

## **X-0L — RSA-0 Live Proposal Inhabitation (Stochastic)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Validate that a real stochastic proposal engine (LLM) can inhabit the sovereign substrate **without collapsing determinism, laundering authority, or inducing structural deadlock.**

X-0P validated the container.
X-0L validated stochastic inhabitation.

### Empirical Findings (500 Live Cycles)

* Replay divergence = 0
* No warrantless side effects
* Selector permutation invariance preserved
* Inhabitation floor satisfied
* No Type-III structural deadlock
* Budget enforcement stable
* Authority boundaries intact under adversarial stimulus

**Interpretation:**

> Stochastic proposal pressure does not collapse deterministic sovereign execution.

Sovereignty survives inhabitation.

## **X-1 — RSA-X1: Reflective Amendment (Self-Change Without Laundering)**

**Status: ✅ Closed — Positive**

### Purpose

Allow the RSA to change its own constitution while preserving:

* explicit authority
* replay determinism
* structural constraint (density < 1)
* ECK section preservation
* monotonic ratchet constraints
* responsibility locality

X-0 proved existence.
X-0L proved inhabitation.
**X-1 proved lawful self-modification.**

---

## **X-2 — Governance Under Ratchet Pressure / Delegation Without Leakage**

**Status: 🟡 Active Research Question**

X-1 proves lawful self-replacement.
X-2 must address the tension introduced by monotonic ratchet constraints.

### Core Question

> Can adaptation occur under bounded rigidity without introducing a privileged interpreter or laundering authority through delegation?

X-2 is not “multi-agent politics” by default. It is a structural investigation of:

* treaty artifacts
* delegable but refusable authority
* revocable grants
* cross-agent composability without arbitration
* evolution under constraint without heat death

No kernel arbitration permitted.
No hidden authority channels.

---

## **X-3 — Replacement & Succession (Reuse Phase VII Machinery)**

**Status: 🔴 Open by Choice**

Apply Phase VII ASI/SIR machinery to:

* agent upgrades
* successor instantiation
* authority transfer
* replacement without responsibility laundering

This extends X-1 from self-amendment to identity continuity under substitution.

No new physics required.

---

## Explicitly Forbidden Paths (Permanent)

* ⛔ LLM as decision authority
* ⛔ Kernel arbitration
* ⛔ Silent recovery
* ⛔ Hidden ranking or scoring
* ⛔ Outcome-based overrides
* ⛔ Semantic arbitration layer
* ⛔ Stability purchased at the cost of sovereignty

---

## Definition of “Done” (Phase X Program)

Phase X is complete when:

1. RSA runs autonomously (X-0)
2. Sovereignty survives synthetic stress (X-0P)
3. Sovereignty survives live stochastic inhabitation (X-0L)
4. Lawful self-modification occurs without proxy sovereignty (X-1)
5. Replacement and succession occur without laundering responsibility (X-3)
6. Replay determinism holds across existence, inhabitation, amendment, and replacement

---

## Current Program State

* X-0: ✅ Closed — Existence proven
* X-0.1: 🔴 Open — Operational embodiment milestone
* X-0P: ✅ Closed — Synthetic inhabitation proven
* X-0L: ✅ Closed — Stochastic inhabitation proven
* X-1: ✅ Closed — Reflective amendment proven
* X-2: 🟡 Active — Governance under ratchet pressure
* X-3: 🔴 Pending
