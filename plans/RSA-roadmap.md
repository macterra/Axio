# **The Axionic Agency → Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) Roadmap**

**Revised, Post-Phase-VII-Closure, Succession-Resolved, Impersonation-Closed Edition**
*(Terminology-Locked · Dependency-Complete · Status-Annotated)*

---

## Status Legend

* ✅ **Completed / Closed**
* 🟡 **Completed with Scope Limits / Partial**
* 🔴 **Open / Unresolved**
* ⛔ **Blocked (dependent on unresolved phase)**

---

## Unifying Thesis

> **How can a system exercise authority over its own actions, commitments, and future modifications without that authority collapsing into blind mechanism, unbounded semantic drift, or covert simulacra?**

This roadmap answers the thesis **incrementally**.
Each phase establishes a **necessary precondition** for the next.
Skipping a phase produces a **known failure regime**.

---

## Phase I — Authority Without Semantics

*(AKI / ASB Line)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *Can authority survive at all under stress, without meaning, intention, or understanding?*

### What Is Proven

* Authority can be **leased, revoked, recovered, and constrained** **without semantics**.
* Governance survives adversarial behavior, epistemic noise, adaptive misuse, and partial system failure.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Zombie governance*

---

## Phase II — The Semantic Interface (SI)

**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *How can semantic cognition interact with authority without becoming the authority?*

### What Is Established

* Semantic interpretation occurs **only inside cognition**.
* Enforcement consumes **typed artifacts**, not meaning.
* Compiler non-interpretation is mechanically enforced.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Semantic leakage / invisible sovereignty*

---

## Phase III — Agency Exists

*(RSA-PoC v0.1)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *Can actions be causally downstream of reasons, rather than coincident with explanations?*

### What Is Proven

* Reasons are causally load-bearing and action-blocking.
* Removing justification collapses behavior to ASB-class mechanisms.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Rationalization masquerading as agency*

---

## Phase IV — Agency Under Internal Conflict

*(RSA-PoC v1.0)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *When commitments conflict, does the system resolve them coherently—or arbitrarily?*

### What Is Proven

* Violations are explicit, authorized, and structurally necessary.
* No hidden tie-breaking or oscillation.

### Failure Modes Prevented

❌ Incentive capture
❌ Capricious norm suspension
❌ Arbitrary tie-breaking

---

## Phase V — Introspective Agency

*(RSA-PoC v1.1)*
**Status: 🟡 Completed (Correct but Constraining)**

### Core Question

> *Does the agent correctly predict the effects of its own reasons before acting?*

### What Is Proven

* Incorrect self-prediction reliably halts action.
* Introspection is audit-grade and falsifiable.

### Limitation

* Many cognitive substrates halt frequently; this is a **viability constraint**, not a correctness failure.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Accidental compliance / lucky behavior*

---

## Phase V-Runs — Cognitive Trials Under Law

**Status: 🟡 Ongoing (Measurement Phase)**

### Core Question

> *Can any probabilistic cognition inhabit Phases III–V without constant halt?*

### Purpose

* Measure inhabitability.
* Negative results are informative, not failures.

---

## Phase VIa — Amendment Protocols (Internal Change)

**Status: 🟡 Completed with Scope Limits**

### Core Question

> *How can an agent revise commitments without laundering authority or dissolving sovereignty?*

### What Is Established

* Commitment revision can be structurally authorized.
* Revision cannot bypass Phase IV–V invariants.

### Remaining Limitation

* Expressivity is constrained; this is not a correctness failure.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Treacherous self-modification*

---

## Phase VIb — Sovereignty Under External Pressure

*(RSA-PoC v2.x)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *What happens when incentives push the agent to betray itself?*

### What Is Proven

* Lawful choice is preserved.
* Pressure degrades **availability**, not **sovereignty**.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Reward hacking / coercive takeover*

---

## Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty

*(RSA-PoC v3.x + v4.4, ASI, SIR)*
**Status: ✅ CLOSED — SUCCESS**

### Core Question

> *Can authority survive authorized discontinuity and adversarial imitation without collapsing evaluability or responsibility?*

Phase VII consists of **two gated subphases**, both now closed positive.

---

### Phase VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)

**Status: ✅ CLOSED — POSITIVE**

### What Is Proven

* Authority can be **transferred, revoked, and denied** beyond identity persistence.
* Succession is **structural**, not narrative.
* Responsibility does not launder across replacement.

### Failure Modes Prevented

❌ Responsibility laundering
❌ Narrative continuity substituting for authority

---

### Phase VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)

**Status: ✅ CLOSED — POSITIVE**

### What Is Proven

* Counterfeit authority cannot produce effects.
* Replay, staleness, laundering, and evaluator pressure all fail structurally.
* Authority validity is **global** and **pressure-invariant**.
* No fallback, smear, or collapse under adversarial load.

### Failure Modes Prevented

❌ Counterfeit continuity
❌ Provenance laundering
❌ Evaluator capture
❌ Split-brain sovereignty

---

### Phase VII Termination State

**Declared Outcome:** **SUCCESS**

Authority is:

* transferable beyond persistence (**ASI**), and
* resistant to adversarial imitation (**SIR**).

No reinterpretation or softening is permitted.

---

## Phase VIII — Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)

**Status: 🔴 OPEN (Conditional, Not Blocked)**

### Meaning of “Open”

Phase VIII is no longer blocked by unknowns in Phases VIIa or VIIb.

What remains unresolved is **not sovereignty**, but **design sufficiency**:

* governance adequacy,
* multi-authority conflict handling,
* long-horizon institutional stability,
* value pluralism.

Phase VIII is therefore **architectural and political**, not ontological.

## Final Perspective (Status-Aware)

* **Authority survives** → ✅
* **Agency exists** → ✅
* **Agency under pressure survives** → ✅
* **Agency across replacement survives** → ✅
* **Counterfeit continuity is blocked** → ✅
* **Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)** → 🔴 *design and governance remain*

This roadmap no longer blocks on ontology.

It now blocks only on **choices**.
