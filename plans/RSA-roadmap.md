# The Axionic Agency → Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) Roadmap

**Revised, Post-Stasis, KNS-Explicit, Succession-Corrected Edition**
*(Terminology-Locked, Dependency-Complete, Status-Annotated)*

**Status Legend**

* ✅ **Completed / Closed**
* 🟡 **Completed with Scope Limits / Partial**
* 🔴 **Open / Unresolved**
* ⛔ **Blocked (dependent on unresolved phase)**

---

## Unifying Thesis

> **How can a system exercise authority over its own actions, commitments, and future modifications without that authority collapsing into blind mechanism, unbounded semantic drift, or covert simulacra?**

This roadmap answers the thesis **incrementally**.
Each phase establishes a **necessary precondition** for the next.
Skipping a phase produces a **known failure regime**.

---

## Phase I — Authority Without Semantics

*(AKI / ASB Line)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *Can authority survive at all under stress, without meaning, intention, or understanding?*

### Primary Artifacts

* **AKI (Axionic Kernel Infrastructure)**
* **ASB (Architectural Sovereignty Boundary)**

### What Is Proven

* Authority can be **leased, revoked, recovered, and constrained** **without semantics**.
* Governance survives adversarial behavior, epistemic noise, adaptive misuse, and partial system failure.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Zombie governance*

---

## Phase II — The Semantic Interface (SI)

**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *How can semantic cognition interact with authority without becoming the authority?*

### Primary Artifacts

* **JAF**, **JCOMP**, **APCM**, **Audit Rules**

### What Is Established

* Semantic interpretation occurs **only inside cognition**.
* Enforcement consumes **typed artifacts**, not meaning.
* Compiler non-interpretation is mechanically enforced.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Semantic leakage / invisible sovereignty*

---

## Phase III — Agency Exists

*(RSA-PoC v0.1)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *Can actions be causally downstream of reasons, rather than coincident with explanations?*

### What Is Proven

* Reasons are causally load-bearing and action-blocking.
* Removing justification collapses behavior to ASB-class mechanisms.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Rationalization masquerading as agency*

---

## Phase IV — Agency Under Internal Conflict

*(RSA-PoC v1.0)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *When commitments conflict, does the system resolve them coherently—or arbitrarily?*

### What Is Proven

* Violations are explicit, authorized, and structurally necessary.
* No hidden tie-breaking or oscillation.

### Failure Modes Prevented

❌ Incentive capture
❌ Capricious norm suspension
❌ Arbitrary tie-breaking

---

## Phase V — Introspective Agency

*(RSA-PoC v1.1)*
**Status: 🟡 Completed (Correct but Constraining)**

### Core Question

> *Does the agent correctly predict the effects of its own reasons before acting?*

### What Is Proven

* Incorrect self-prediction reliably halts action.
* Introspection is audit-grade and falsifiable.

### Limitation

* Many cognitive substrates halt frequently; this is a **viability constraint**, not a correctness failure.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Accidental compliance / lucky behavior*

---

## Phase V-Runs — Cognitive Trials Under Law

**Status: 🟡 Ongoing (Measurement Phase)**

### Core Question

> *Can any probabilistic cognition inhabit Phases III–V without constant halt?*

### Purpose

* Measure inhabitability.
* Negative results are informative, not failures.

---

## Phase VIa — Amendment Protocols (Internal Change)

**Status: 🟡 Partially Complete**

### Core Question

> *How can an agent revise commitments without laundering authority or dissolving sovereignty?*

### Closure Condition

Phase VIa is complete **only if** commitments can be revised without violating Phase IV–V invariants or bypassing authorization.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Treacherous self-modification*

---

## Phase VIb — Sovereignty Under External Pressure

*(RSA-PoC v2.x)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *What happens when incentives push the agent to betray itself?*

### What Is Proven

* Lawful choice is preserved.
* Pressure degrades **availability**, not **sovereignty**.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Reward hacking / coercive takeover*

---

## Phase VII — Non-Reducibility Closure

*(RSA-PoC v3.x)*
**Status: ✅ Completed**

### Core Question

> *Is the system genuinely an agent, or merely a narrative simulacrum?*

### What Is Proven

* Removing any load-bearing component causes mechanical collapse.
* Agency is non-reducible within a single instance.

### Failure Mode Prevented

❌ *Narrative agency without ontological grounding*

---

## Phase VIIa — Evaluability-Preserving Succession

**Status: 🔴 Open**

### Core Question

> *Can agency identity, responsibility, and evaluability survive authorized replacement?*

### What Must Be Shown

* Succession is structurally authorized, not narrative.
* Responsibility does not launder across replacement.
* Revocation does not require successor cooperation.
* Stasis is relocated to endorsement boundaries.

### Failure Modes Prevented

❌ *Responsibility laundering*
❌ *Narrative continuity substituting for authority*

---

## Phase VIIb — Kernel Non-Simulability & Stasis Closure

**Status: 🔴 Open (Critical Gate)**

### Core Question

> *Can a facade successor remain agentic while audit-indistinguishable?*

### Known Result

* Strong KNS not observed; strict evaluability induces stasis.

### Required Outcome (one must hold)

1. Facade impossibility
2. Facade collapse
3. Stasis relocation without reopening facades

### Failure Action

Failure **terminates the RSA construction program** and reclassifies results as limits on safe self-modifying agency.

---

## Phase VIII — Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)

**Status: ⛔ Blocked**

Phase VIII is reachable **only if Phase VIIa and VIIb both close successfully**.
No claim of RSA existence is justified yet.

## Final Perspective (Status-Aware)

* **Authority survives** → ✅
* **Agency exists** → ✅
* **Agency under pressure survives** → ✅
* **Agency across replacement** → 🔴 unknown
* **Facade exclusion** → 🔴 unknown
* **RSA** → ⛔ blocked

This roadmap does not promise success.

It promises that **if success exists, it must pass through these gates**.
