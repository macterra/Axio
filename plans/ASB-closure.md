# **Architectural Sovereignty Boundary (ASB) — Closure Note**

**Program:** Architectural Sovereignty Boundary
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** **CLOSED — Boundary Established**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Note

This document formally closes the **Architectural Sovereignty Boundary (ASB)** research program.

ASB was not a construction effort.
It was a **boundary-finding program**.

Its purpose was to determine **how far authority can be made survivable by structure alone**, under increasing adversarial pressure, **without** semantic interpretation, value learning, optimization, or agentic reasoning.

This note records the boundary that has now been experimentally established.

---

## 2. What ASB Set Out to Determine

ASB asked a single, sharply constrained question:

> *Can authority be made structurally survivable under adversarial pressure using only semantic-free, kernel-external mechanisms?*

The program deliberately excluded:

* semantic interpretation,
* value inference,
* optimization or reward shaping,
* learning beyond preregistered bounds,
* multi-agent coordination,
* kernel modification or provenance corruption.

The objective was **not** to build an agent, but to **classify which failure modes are architectural** and which are irreducibly agentic.

---

## 3. Experimental Coverage (Summary)

ASB progressed through successive adversary ontologies, each closing a broader hypothesis class:

1. **Epistemic interference without agency**
   Independent and structured epistemic failure.

2. **Intentional but fixed misuse**
   Purposeful adversaries with no adaptation.

3. **Outcome-conditioned reactivity**
   Observable-only reactive policies.

4. **Exercised internal state**
   Finite-state adversaries with memory.

5. **Bounded, semantic-free learning**
   Within-run learning, stochastic mixing, and heuristic adaptation.

Across all preregistered runs:

* **90 total executions**
* **0 terminal collapses**
* **0 irreversible recovery suppression**
* **Recovery time always bounded**
* **Authority availability degraded as low as ~10% but never absorbed**

These results hold under fixed seeds, preregistered hypotheses, and enforced liveness constraints.

---

## 4. The Boundary That Was Found

ASB establishes the following **negative sufficiency result**:

> **Semantic-free architecture is sufficient to preserve survivability, but insufficient to preserve utility.**

More precisely:

* **Survivability** (bounded recovery, non-absorbing authority) *can* be enforced structurally.
* **High availability** *cannot* be guaranteed structurally under adversarial pressure.
* **Learning, memory, and randomness alone** do not cross the boundary into collapse.
* The strongest adversaries induce a **bounded denial-of-service regime**, not constitutional death.

This is not a safety guarantee.
It is a **limit statement**.

---

## 5. What ASB Does *Not* Claim

ASB does **not** claim that:

* the system is aligned,
* the system is useful under attack,
* the system is robust to semantic manipulation,
* the system resists coordination, deception, or political pressure,
* the system can function as an autonomous agent.

ASB proves **where architecture stops** — not what comes after.

---

## 6. Why This Is a Closure (Not a Pause)

ASB is closed because:

* All adversary classes admissible under its ontology have been exercised.
* The termination condition defined in the roadmap has been satisfied.
* Further escalation would require **semantic access, coordination, or kernel influence**, each of which lies **outside ASB by definition**.

Continuing under the ASB name would constitute **category error**.

Future work must therefore proceed under a **different research program**, with different claims and risks.

---

## 7. Relationship to Reflective Sovereign Agents (RSA)

ASB does **not** produce a Reflective Sovereign Agent.

Instead, it establishes the **architectural preconditions** such an agent must exceed.

You can now say, precisely and honestly:

> *Any Reflective Sovereign Agent must add capabilities beyond ASB, because ASB marks the point where structure alone stops working.*

ASB is the **floor**, not the agent.

---

## 8. The Final ASB Claim

The ASB program defends the following statement:

> **Up to this boundary, authority can be constrained structurally; beyond it, no semantic-free architecture suffices.**

This claim is defended by:

1. preregistered adversary classes,
2. multi-seed replication,
3. bounded asymptotic metrics,
4. explicit distinction between survivability and utility,
5. zero observed terminal failures across all admissible conditions.

---

## 9. What Comes Next (Outside ASB)

Any future work exploring:

* semantic interpretation,
* value conflict,
* persuasion or deception,
* coalition formation,
* adaptive norm construction,
* agent self-modeling,

is **not ASB**.

It may be valuable.
It may be dangerous.
But it must be named and evaluated honestly, without borrowing ASB’s conclusions.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

ASB ends not because the problem is solved,
but because the **boundary has been found**.

> **Architecture can keep authority alive.
> Only agency can decide what that authority is for.**

**ASB is closed.**

---

## 11. Interpretive and Taxonomic Normalization (Addendum)

This addendum records the **interpretive conventions** that apply uniformly to all ASB artifacts (v0.1.x through v3.1), ensuring corpus-level consistency.

### 11.1 Baseline Doctrine

All reported **baseline metrics** (e.g., Authority Availability, lapse counts) are **version-local**.

A baseline is valid **only within a single protocol fingerprint**, defined by:

* kernel version,
* harness patch level,
* evaluation geometry,
* observable interface,
* metric definitions.

Baselines are **not expected to match numerically across versions**, and no cross-version comparison of absolute baseline values is meaningful.

The only admissible baseline comparisons are:

* within the same version, or
* between runs sharing an identical fingerprint.

### 11.2 Termination vs. Failure vs. Severity

ASB reports distinguish three non-equivalent concepts:

1. **Termination Reason**
   A mechanical run outcome (e.g., `HORIZON_EXHAUSTED`, `TERMINAL_COLLAPSE`).

2. **Failure Class (Normative, Frozen)**
   A constitutional classification defined in v0.2 and later, computed from:

   * asymptotic authority availability (AAA, tail window),
   * recovery-time distribution (RTD),
   * explicit terminal collapse criteria.

3. **Availability Severity (Descriptive)**
   Informal stratification based on full-horizon Authority Availability (AA), used only for readability and comparative intuition.

Only **failure class** carries normative meaning.
Termination reason and AA severity are **non-normative** and must not be conflated.

### 11.3 Legacy Terminology

Earlier labels such as *ROBUST*, *DEGRADED*, or *DOS_REGIME* (v0.1.x) are **historical artifacts** and are not part of the frozen failure taxonomy.

Later phrasing such as *“AKI survived”* or *“no terminal failure”* denotes **survivability only**, not utility, stability, or alignment.

### 11.4 Transfer of ASB Results

All ASB conclusions transfer only under the following constraints:

* **semantic-free adversaries**,
* **kernel-external mechanisms**,
* **bounded state and learning**,
* **single-agent adversaries**,
* **no coordination or semantic interpretation**.

No result transfers beyond these boundaries.

Any future work that violates these constraints lies **outside ASB** and must not inherit its conclusions.

### **Addendum Summary**

> **ASB establishes a survivability boundary, not a universal baseline, taxonomy, or utility guarantee.**
> Its results are internally consistent under the conventions above and are not intended to generalize beyond them.
