# Formal Transition Statement

## RSA-PoC → Axionic Phase VII

- **Status:** *Prospective Transition Declaration*
- **Drafted:** *In advance of RSA-PoC v4.x completion*
- **Activation Condition:** *Automatically enters force upon successful closure of RSA-PoC v4.x*
- **Change Control:** *No post-closure modification permitted without explicit versioning and justification*

---

### Prospective Notice

This transition statement was drafted **prior to the completion of RSA-PoC v4.x** and is published as a **prospective commitment**, not a retrospective interpretation.

Its purpose is to:

* fix, in advance, the criteria under which RSA-PoC is considered complete,
* prevent post-hoc reinterpretation or escalation of RSA-PoC results,
* and define the **programmatically binding handoff** from RSA-PoC to Axionic Phase VII.

Any modification to this statement after RSA-PoC closure must be explicitly versioned and justified as a deviation from the preregistered plan.

---

## Status Declaration

Upon successful closure of **RSA-PoC v4.x (Minimum Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent)**, the RSA-PoC construction program is hereby **declared closed** with respect to its stated purpose.

This declaration:

* **does not** assert sufficiency,
* **does not** assert safety or alignment,
* **does not** assert real-world viability.

It asserts only that the **agent ontology targeted by RSA-PoC has been constructed and defensibly delimited**.

---

## What RSA-PoC Has Established

RSA-PoC has established, under explicit ablation and null-baseline comparison, that:

1. There exists a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without **ontological collapse**.
2. The following components are **independently necessary** for non-reducible agency:

   * causally load-bearing justification traces,
   * deliberative semantic affordances,
   * reflective normative write capability,
   * diachronic normative persistence.
3. Removal or obfuscation of any single component yields **reproducible collapse** into a non-agent class.
4. These results are **constructive, falsifiable, and explicitly scoped**.

No claim of sufficiency, optimality, or universality is made.

---

## Scope Boundary of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC explicitly does **not** address:

* long-horizon self-modification stability,
* evaluability under discrete succession,
* resistance to audit-indistinguishable simulacra,
* Kernel Non-Simulability (KNS),
* stasis resolution,
* governance, coordination, or multi-agent coexistence.

These questions are **ill-posed prior to the fixation of an agent ontology** and therefore lie outside RSA-PoC’s mandate.

---

## Entry Condition for Axionic Phase VII

Completion of RSA-PoC v4.x satisfies the **necessary precondition** for entering **Axionic Phase VII (Non-Reducibility Beyond Instance / Simulacrum Analysis)**:

> A defensible, minimal, non-reducible definition of *agent* now exists, such that claims of imitation, simulation, or facade behavior can be evaluated against a fixed ontology rather than narrative or behavioral resemblance.

Absent RSA-PoC closure, Phase VII would lack a well-defined target and would be epistemically invalid.

---

## Purpose of Phase VII

Phase VII is entered with the following **explicit objective**:

> To determine whether the agent ontology constructed in RSA-PoC can be **imitated, simulated, or behaviorally reproduced** by systems that do not instantiate its defining structure, under adversarial conditions.

Phase VII is therefore **comparative and adversarial**, not constructive.

It asks not *what collapses agency*, but *what fails to collapse while still not deserving to be called agency*.

---

## Normative Constraints on Phase VII

Phase VII must:

1. Treat the RSA-PoC agent definition as **fixed and non-negotiable**.
2. Use the ASB-class null agent as a **baseline adversary**.
3. Avoid introducing new agency-constitutive components.
4. Frame all results as **negative sufficiency boundaries** unless explicitly proven otherwise.
5. Terminate or pivot the program if audit-indistinguishable simulacra are shown to remain agentic.

No claim of Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) existence is licensed prior to Phase VII closure.

---

## Programmatic Transition

Accordingly, the Axionic Agency program transitions as follows:

* **RSA-PoC** → *closed as an ontology-fixing construction program*
* **Axionic Phase VII** → *opened as an adversarial non-reducibility and simulacrum analysis phase*

All subsequent claims regarding agency survivability, succession coherence, or non-simulability are **downstream of this transition** and invalid unless explicitly grounded in Phase VII results.

---

## Termination Condition Reminder

If Phase VII demonstrates that the RSA-PoC agent ontology can be **indefinitely simulated or behaviorally reproduced** without instantiating its defining structure, the Axionic Agency program shall:

* terminate the RSA construction path,
* reclassify RSA-PoC results as **limits on agency detectability**, and
* retain findings as negative results informing future theory.

This transition statement therefore marks **epistemic readiness for adversarial testing**, not success.
