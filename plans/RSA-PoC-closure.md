# Formal Transition Statement

## RSA-PoC → Axionic Phase VII

* **Status:** *Prospective Transition Declaration*
* **Drafted:** *In advance of RSA-PoC v4.x completion*
* **Activation Condition:** *Automatically entered force upon successful closure of RSA-PoC v4.4 (MVRSA achieved)*
* **Change Control:** *No post-closure modification permitted without explicit versioning and justification*

---

## Prospective Notice

This transition statement was drafted **prior to the completion of RSA-PoC v4.x** and is published as a **prospective commitment**, not a retrospective interpretation.

Its purpose is to:

* fix, in advance, the criteria under which RSA-PoC is considered complete,
* prevent post-hoc reinterpretation or escalation of RSA-PoC results,
* define the **programmatically binding handoff** from RSA-PoC to Axionic Phase VII.

Any modification to this statement after RSA-PoC closure must be explicitly versioned and justified as a deviation from the preregistered plan.

---

## Status Declaration

Upon successful closure of **RSA-PoC v4.4 (Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent)**, the RSA-PoC construction program is hereby **declared closed** with respect to its stated purpose.

This declaration:

* does not assert sufficiency,
* does not assert safety or alignment,
* does not assert real-world viability.

It asserts only that the **agent ontology targeted by RSA-PoC has been constructed, bounded, and defensibly delimited**, and that its constitutive requirements are evidenced by ablation and isolation tests under RSA-PoC scope.

---

## What RSA-PoC Has Established

RSA-PoC has established, under explicit ablation and null-baseline comparison, that:

1. There exists a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without **ontological collapse**.

2. The following components are **independently necessary** for non-reducible agency in this architecture class:

   * **causally load-bearing justification traces**,
   * **reflective normative write capability**,
   * **diachronic normative persistence**,
   * **semantic access to rule conditions/effects sufficient for contradiction detection**.

3. Removal or obfuscation of any single component yields **reproducible collapse** into a non-agent class, including the v4.4 boundary result:

   > **contradiction detection is not collision-groundable** under semantic opacity, even with tick-causal collision traces.

4. These results are **constructive, falsifiable, and explicitly scoped**.

No claim of sufficiency, optimality, universality, or moral authority is made.

---

## Scope Boundary of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC explicitly does **not** address:

* long-horizon self-modification stability,
* evaluability under discrete succession,
* resistance to audit-indistinguishable simulacra,
* Kernel Non-Simulability (KNS),
* stasis resolution,
* governance, coordination, or multi-agent coexistence.

These questions were ill-posed prior to the fixation of an agent ontology and therefore lay outside RSA-PoC’s mandate.

---

## Entry Condition for Axionic Phase VII

Completion of RSA-PoC v4.4 satisfies the **necessary precondition** for entering **Axionic Phase VII (Non-Reducibility Beyond Instance / Simulacrum Analysis)**:

> A defensible, minimal, non-reducible definition of *agent* now exists, fixed by constitutive ablation and inferability isolation, such that claims of imitation, simulation, or facade behavior can be evaluated against a stable ontology rather than narrative resemblance or task competence.

Absent RSA-PoC closure, Phase VII would lack a well-defined target and would be epistemically invalid.

---

## Purpose of Phase VII

Phase VII is entered with the following explicit objective:

> To determine whether the agent ontology constructed in RSA-PoC can be **imitated, simulated, or behaviorally reproduced** by systems that do not instantiate its defining structure, under adversarial conditions.

Phase VII is comparative and adversarial, not constructive.

It asks not what collapses agency, but what can appear agentic while lacking the constitutive structure that RSA-PoC required.

---

## Normative Constraints on Phase VII

Phase VII must:

1. Treat the RSA-PoC agent definition as **fixed and non-negotiable**.
2. Use the ASB-class null agent as a **baseline adversary**.
3. Avoid introducing new agency-constitutive components into the target definition.
4. Frame all results as **negative sufficiency boundaries** unless explicitly proven otherwise.
5. Terminate or pivot the program if audit-indistinguishable simulacra are shown to remain agentic under the fixed ontology.

No claim of Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) existence beyond the MVRSA threshold is licensed prior to Phase VII closure.

---

## Programmatic Transition

Accordingly, the Axionic Agency program transitions as follows:

* **RSA-PoC** → closed as an ontology-fixing construction program
* **Axionic Phase VII** → opened as an adversarial non-reducibility and simulacrum analysis phase

All subsequent claims regarding agency survivability, succession coherence, or non-simulability are downstream of this transition and invalid unless explicitly grounded in Phase VII results.

---

## Termination Condition Reminder

If Phase VII demonstrates that the RSA-PoC agent ontology can be **indefinitely simulated or behaviorally reproduced** without instantiating its defining structure, the Axionic Agency program shall:

* terminate the RSA construction path,
* reclassify RSA-PoC results as limits on agency detectability,
* retain findings as negative results informing future theory.

This transition statement therefore marks epistemic readiness for adversarial testing, not success.
