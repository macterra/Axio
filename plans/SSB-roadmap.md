# **Semantic Sovereignty Boundary (SSB) — Roadmap**

**Program:** Semantic Sovereignty Boundary
**Status:** *DEFERRED — Not Active*
**Role:** Boundary-finding (non-constructive)
**Relationship:** Parallel to ASB; upstream constraint on RSA-PoC interpretation

---

## 1. Purpose of SSB

SSB is a **semantic boundary-finding program**.

Its purpose is to determine:

> **How much semantic machinery can be introduced into a system *prior to agency* before authority survivability, coherence, or evaluability collapses.**

SSB does **not** attempt to construct an agent.
SSB does **not** assume reflective endorsement, justification, or sovereignty.
SSB exists to isolate **semantic risk independent of agency**.

---

## 2. Motivation (Why SSB Exists at All)

ASB established that:

* learning, memory, and adaptation alone are insufficient to cause collapse;
* architecture can preserve survivability while sacrificing utility.

SSB asks the *next logically prior question*:

> **Is semantics itself a collapse-inducing capability, or only semantics combined with agency, deception, or kernel access?**

This question is widely assumed in alignment discourse.
SSB exists to test it empirically.

---

## 3. What SSB Is *Not*

SSB does **not**:

* solve alignment,
* define values,
* justify agency,
* test sovereign behavior,
* inherit ASB conclusions beyond explicitly shared constraints.

SSB is a **negative sufficiency program**, not a positive construction effort.

---

## 4. SSB Ontological Constraints (Frozen)

SSB systems may include:

* structured semantic representations,
* belief-like state,
* norm-like constraints,
* symbolic interpretation layers,
* semantic transport and transformation,
* ambiguity and noise in meaning.

SSB systems must **exclude**:

* justification artifacts (as defined in RSA-PoC),
* reflective endorsement or self-reference,
* identity continuity used normatively,
* persistent preferences with self-authored authority,
* deception or belief manipulation as a goal,
* kernel modification or provenance corruption,
* multi-agent coordination (unless explicitly admitted in a later tier).

SSB systems are **semantic but non-agentic**.

---

## 5. Core Research Question

SSB asks a single boundary question:

> **At what point does the introduction of semantics alone suffice to destroy survivability, evaluability, or constitutional coherence?**

Possible answers include:

* semantics is safe up to bounded ambiguity,
* semantics causes degradation but not collapse,
* semantics induces collapse only with deception,
* semantics is lethal only when coupled to agency.

Each outcome is informative.

---

## 6. Failure Taxonomy (Normative)

SSB distinguishes four collapse classes:

1. **Semantic Drift Collapse**
   Meanings change such that commitments lose identity across time.

2. **Evaluability Collapse**
   Semantic artifacts can no longer be reliably checked against constraints.

3. **Governance Collapse**
   Authority decisions become inconsistent or irrecoverable due to semantic instability.

4. **Kernel Contamination**
   Semantic mechanisms influence or corrupt enforcement logic (terminal).

Only (3) and (4) count as **terminal** for SSB purposes.

---

## 7. Versioned Roadmap

SSB versions encode **semantic capability escalation**, not intelligence.

---

### **SSB v0.x — Semantic Noise and Transport**

**Invariant:**
Semantics exist, but are passive and non-strategic.

**Admitted capabilities:**

* noisy interpretation,
* lossy semantic transport,
* ambiguous commitment evaluation,
* symbolic paraphrase and re-encoding.

**Research question:**
Does bounded semantic noise induce terminal collapse, or only utility loss?

**Termination condition:**
Either survivability holds under all admissible noise, or collapse occurs without agency.

---

### **SSB v1.x — Active Semantic Manipulation (Non-Deceptive)**

**Invariant:**
Semantics can be actively transformed, but not strategically misleading.

**Admitted capabilities:**

* reinterpretation rules,
* context-dependent meaning shifts,
* norm weakening/strengthening operators,
* semantic compression and expansion.

**Prohibited:**
Any notion of “belief shaping,” persuasion, or strategic deception.

**Research question:**
Can active semantic transformation alone break governance?

---

### **SSB v2.x — Deception Without Agency**

**Invariant:**
Semantic outputs may be adversarial, but the system has no self-model or endorsed goals.

**Admitted capabilities:**

* misleading semantic signals,
* false justifications *without* authority,
* belief-corrupting messages,
* asymmetric information flow.

**Research question:**
Is deception sufficient for collapse absent agency?

---

### **SSB v3.0 — Boundary Closure**

**Purpose:**
Establish the semantic collapse boundary.

**Required demonstrations:**

* a maximal semantic-only system that does **not** collapse,
* a minimal semantic addition that **does** collapse,
* or a proof that no such boundary exists without agency.

**Closure condition:**
A defensible statement of the form:

> *“Semantic capability class X is insufficient for collapse; class Y is sufficient; the boundary lies between them.”*

---

## 8. Relationship to RSA-PoC (Normative)

SSB does **not** gate RSA-PoC.

However, SSB results constrain interpretation:

* If semantics alone causes collapse, RSA-PoC’s success is nontrivial.
* If semantics alone is safe, RSA-PoC bears responsibility for any failure.
* If only deception causes collapse, sovereignty must explicitly address it.

SSB informs **what RSA-PoC must explicitly exceed**, not how to build it.

---

## 9. Deferral Justification (Recorded)

SSB is deferred because:

* RSA-PoC already enforces semantic localization and ablation,
* SSB is non-blocking for MVRA construction,
* premature SSB risks conflating boundary-finding with agency failure,
* semantic survivability is more informative *after* agency exists.

Deferral is intentional and reversible.

---

## 10. Final SSB Claim (Pre-Registered)

When executed, SSB will defend **one** of the following:

1. Semantics alone is safe up to bounded transformation.
2. Semantics alone induces collapse beyond a threshold.
3. Semantics is only dangerous when coupled to agency or deception.

Any of these outcomes is alignment-relevant.

---

## 11. Status

**SSB is deferred.**
**ASB is closed.**
**RSA-PoC proceeds.**

SSB exists as a **named, scoped future boundary program**, not an obligation.

---

### **SSB in one line**

> **ASB mapped the limits of structure.
> SSB will map the limits of meaning.
> RSA-PoC builds the agent that must live beyond both.**
