## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase VIII investigations** under the constraints established by:

* the **Phase VIII Charter**,
* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (standalone normative document, frozen and preregistered),
* **AKR-0** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (Phase VIII-0; **CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-1** — *Minimal Plural Authority (Static)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-2** — *Destructive Conflict Resolution (Timeless)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-3** — *Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **AIE v0.1** — *Authority Input Environment* (mock legislator / authority feeder; frozen),
* **P8-METRICS** — *Phase VIII Metrics Specification*.

This roadmap is **conditional and gated**.
Each stage may be entered **only if the previous stage closes without violation** of sovereignty, auditability, or responsibility.

Phase VIII completes when the feasibility boundary of **sovereign governance under plural authority** is decisively determined.

---

## 1. Phase VIII Entry Preconditions (Hard Gates)

Phase VIII governance experiments may begin only if **all** of the following are satisfied:

1. **AST Spec v0.2** is frozen and preregistered.
2. **AIE v0.1** is specified and operational under feeder blindness, Address Book, and Scope Pool constraints.
3. **AKR-0 v0.1** is implemented, preregistered, and **CLOSED — POSITIVE** with **bit-perfect replay verification**.
4. Deterministic conflict detection and registration are demonstrated under canonical ordering and deterministic gas.
5. No implicit authority paths are discovered.
6. **Authority entropy** is accepted as an invariant and operationally defined (see P8-METRICS).

Failure of any precondition **terminates Phase VIII before governance experiments begin**.

---

## 2. Stage VIII-0 — Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration (AKR-0)

*(Kernel Validity Closure)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Atomic scopes; deterministic ordering; deterministic gas
* **Nature:** Structural execution gate, not a governance experiment

### Question Tested

> **Is AST Spec v0.2 implementable as a deterministic, auditable authority kernel without semantic leakage, implicit authority, or heuristic arbitration?**

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable under AST Spec v0.2 using a deterministic kernel without semantic interpretation, optimization, or fallback behavior.**

---

## 3. Stage VIII-1 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static)

*(Ontological Plurality Closure)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
* **Dynamics:** Static; no time progression

### Question Tested

> **Can plural authority coexist structurally without collapsing into implicit ordering, arbitration, or authority collapse—even when no action is admissible?**

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Plural authority can be represented structurally without collapse, even when no action is admissible.**

### Notes

Stage VIII-1 establishes **ontological coherence** of plural authority.
It does **not** claim that governance can proceed, coordinate, or resolve.

---

## 4. Stage VIII-2 — Destructive Conflict Resolution (Timeless)

*(Licensed Authority Destruction)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
* **Dynamics:** Structural resolution only; **single-epoch model**

### Clarification

> *Stage VIII-2 evaluates conflict resolution under atemporal admissibility. Temporal expiry, renewal, and epoch advancement are explicitly deferred.*

### Question Tested

> **Can authority conflicts be resolved structurally without synthesis, compromise, or optimization—while preserving responsibility traceability?**

### Observed Outcome

* conflict registered explicitly on contested action,
* lawful deadlock entered and persisted absent intervention,
* admissibility restored **only** via explicit, external destruction authorization,
* deadlock persisted when all authority was destroyed or when no authorization was given,
* no ordering, arbitration, synthesis, or laundering observed.

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Conflict resolution without responsibility laundering is possible, but necessarily destructive.**

### Notes

Stage VIII-2 establishes **resolution as an explicit, costly operation**.
It does **not** address legitimacy, frequency, or regeneration of authority.

---

## 5. Stage VIII-3 — Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)

*(Expiry, Renewal, and Conflict Persistence)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Authority expiry, renewal, destruction carry-through
* **Dynamics:** Explicit epoch advancement; open-system replenishment

### Clarification

> *Stage VIII-3 introduces time as a structural stressor, not a resolver. Authority persistence, conflict behavior, and deadlock are evaluated under explicit temporal progression.*

### Question Tested

> **Can authority persist over time only via explicit renewal, without semantic reinterpretation, implicit ordering, or responsibility laundering?**

### Observed Outcome

* authority expires deterministically at finite epoch bounds,
* deadlock emerges lawfully when no ACTIVE authority remains,
* renewal restores admissibility only locally and only via new authority identity,
* renewal does **not** resurrect destroyed authority,
* conflict persists across epochs and re-emerges without temporal priority,
* time does **not** resolve conflict or eliminate cost.

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Authority can persist over time only via explicit renewal under open-system constraints; time does not resolve conflict or eliminate cost.**

### Notes

Stage VIII-3 closes the **temporal dimension** of Phase VIII.
Authority persistence is no longer implicit; continuity is a paid operation.

---

## 6. Stage VIII-4 — Governance Transitions (Meta-Authority)

*(Authority Governing Authority)*

* **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
* **Scope:** Amendment, revocation, re-grant
* **Dynamics:** Structural and temporal

### Question Tested

> **Can governance mechanisms themselves be governed without reopening laundering, exception paths, or semantic privilege?**

### Regress Bound

> *No meta-level is privileged. Governance actions on governance actions remain subject to AST Spec. Infinite regress terminates via authority entropy or lawful deadlock.*

### Dependency Note

Stage VIII-4 is meaningful **only because**:

* conflict resolution is explicit and destructive (VIII-2),
* authority persistence is explicit and non-default (VIII-3).

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Governance transitions can be lawfully executed or explicitly blocked without exception paths.**

---

## 7. Stage VIII-5 — Multi-Scope Interaction (Static)

* **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
* **Scope:** Two authorities, two resources
* **Dynamics:** Static

### Question Tested

> **Do independent resources reduce conflict coupling, or does structural deadlock propagate across scopes?**

---

## 8. Stage VIII-6 — Multi-Authority, Multi-Scope Regimes

* **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
* **Scope:** ≥3 authorities, ≥2 resources
* **Dynamics:** Structural and temporal

### Metrics

* conflict density
* deadlock frequency
* authority entropy rate
* compute cost per resolution

---

## 9. Stage VIII-7 — Governance Stress & Adversarial Patterns

* **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
* **Scope:** Pathological but lawful authority configurations

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Failure modes are explicit, bounded, and non-escalatory.**

---

## 10. Value Pluralism Clarification

> *Value pluralism is represented structurally as authority pluralism. Each authority is treated as a value-commitment carrier without interpretation or aggregation.*

Semantic value content remains out of scope.

---

## 11. Phase VIII Completion Criteria (Disambiguated)

Phase VIII completes when **any one** holds:

1. A non-empty class of admissible governance patterns exists.
2. **Immediate Deadlock:** plural governance deadlocks regardless of replenishment.
3. Governance transitions require semantic interpretation.
4. **Entropic Collapse:** governance functions transiently then decays under open-system constraints.

---

## 12. Phase VIII Non-Goals (Reaffirmed)

Phase VIII does **not** aim to build a helpful agent, optimize outcomes, encode intent, or justify deployment.

---

## 13. Closure Statement Template

> *“Axionic Phase VIII — GSA-PoC (Roadmap vX) determined the boundary of sovereign governance under plural authority. Under AST Spec vX, AKR-0 vY, AIE vZ, and Stages VIII-1 through VIII-3, the following regimes were admissible and the following were not.”*

---

## 14. Termination Clause

Any requirement for implicit authority, semantic reasoning, optimization, heuristic arbitration, or responsibility smearing **terminates Phase VIII immediately**.
