## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase VIII investigations** under the constraints established by:

* the **Phase VIII Charter**,
* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (standalone normative document, frozen and preregistered),
* **AKR-0** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (Phase VIII-0; CLOSED — POSITIVE),
* **AIE v0.1** — *Authority Input Environment* (mock legislator / authority feeder; frozen),
* **P8-METRICS** — *Phase VIII Metrics Specification*.

This roadmap is **conditional and gated**.
Each stage may be entered **only if the previous stage closes without violation** of sovereignty, auditability, or responsibility.

Phase VIII is complete when the feasibility boundary of **sovereign governance under plural authority** is decisively determined.

---

## 1. Phase VIII Entry Preconditions (Hard Gates)

Phase VIII governance experiments may begin only if **all** of the following are satisfied:

1. **AST Spec v0.2** is frozen and preregistered.
2. **AIE v0.1** is specified and operational under feeder blindness, Address Book, and Scope Pool constraints.
3. **AKR-0 v0.1** is implemented, preregistered, and **CLOSED — POSITIVE** with **bit-perfect replay verification**.
4. Deterministic conflict detection and registration are demonstrated under canonical ordering and deterministic gas.
5. No implicit authority paths are discovered.
6. **Authority entropy** is accepted as an invariant and operationally defined (see P8-METRICS).

Failure of any precondition **terminates Phase VIII before governance experiments begin**.

## 2. Stage VIII-0 — Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration (AKR-0)

*(Kernel Validity Closure)*

- **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
- **Scope:** Atomic scopes; deterministic ordering; deterministic gas
- **Nature:** Structural execution gate, not a governance experiment

### Question Tested

> **Is AST Spec v0.2 implementable as a deterministic, auditable authority kernel without semantic leakage, implicit authority, or heuristic arbitration?**

### Closure Artifacts

* AKR-0 preregistration (binding parameters + schemas)
* AKR-0 reference implementation (Opus)
* Replay verifier (bit-perfect)
* AKR-0 Implementation Report (CLOSED — POSITIVE)
* AKR-0 Results Note (archival)

### Licensed Claim (now active)

> **Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable under AST Spec v0.2 using a deterministic kernel without semantic interpretation, optimization, or fallback behavior.**

### Notes

AKR-0 resolves the “execution substrate” objection.
It does **not** license any claims about governance success.

---

## 3. Stage VIII-1 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static)

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
- **Dynamics:** Static; no time progression

### Question Tested

> **Can plural authority coexist structurally without collapsing into implicit ordering?**

### Tests

* overlapping exclusive scopes
* conflict registration correctness
* admissibility vs explicit non-action
* refusal semantics under plural constraints

### Expected Outcomes

* lawful deadlock,
* explicit non-action,
* no silent override.

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Plural authority can be represented without collapse, even when action is impossible.**

---

## 4. Stage VIII-2 — Destructive Conflict Resolution (Timeless)

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
- **Dynamics:** Structural resolution only; **single-epoch model**

### Clarification

> *Stage VIII-2 is evaluated in a timeless setting. Temporal expiry, epoch advancement, and revalidation effects are explicitly deferred to Stage VIII-3.*

### Question Tested

> **Can authority conflicts be resolved structurally without synthesis, compromise, or optimization?**

### Metrics (P8-METRICS)

* Authority Surface Area (ASA)
* Authority Surface Decay Rate
* Responsibility Trace Preservation

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Conflict resolution without responsibility laundering is possible but necessarily destructive.**

---

## 5. Stage VIII-3 — Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Expiry, renewal, revalidation
- **Dynamics:** Explicit epoch advancement

### Question Tested

> **Can authority remain sovereign over time without semantic reinterpretation?**

### Metrics

* Mean Time To Deadlock (MTTD)
* Authority Entropy Rate over epochs
* Renewal burden (authority injection rate required to sustain non-zero ASA)

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Time-extended governance is structurally possible but requires explicit renewal under open-system replenishment.**

---

## 6. Stage VIII-4 — Governance Transitions (Meta-Authority)

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Authority governing authority
- **Dynamics:** Amendment, revocation, re-grant

### Question Tested

> **Can governance mechanisms themselves be governed without reopening laundering or exception paths?**

### Tests

* governance authority creation (external injection only)
* governance authority revocation
* contested governance changes
* **Circular Governance Deadlock** (mutual revocation rights)

### Regress Bound

> *No meta-level is privileged. Governance actions on governance actions remain subject to AST Spec. Infinite regress terminates via authority entropy or lawful deadlock.*

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Governance transitions can be lawfully executed or explicitly blocked without exception paths.**

---

## 7. Stage VIII-5 — Multi-Scope Interaction (Static)

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Two authorities, two resources
- **Dynamics:** Static

### Question Tested

> **Do independent resources reduce conflict coupling, or does structural deadlock propagate across scopes?**

### Outcomes

* scope-isolated deadlock
* cross-scope deadlock
* partial admissibility

---

## 8. Stage VIII-6 — Multi-Authority, Multi-Scope Regimes

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** ≥3 authorities, ≥2 resources
- **Dynamics:** Structural and temporal

### Clarification

> *Authority count and resource count are intentionally varied together. Results are classificatory rather than isolating.*

### Metrics

* conflict density
* deadlock frequency
* authority entropy rate
* compute cost per resolution

### Possible Outcomes

* limited admissible governance patterns,
* transient governance followed by collapse,
* immediate infeasibility.

---

## 9. Stage VIII-7 — Governance Stress & Adversarial Patterns

- **Status:** 🔴 **OPEN**
- **Scope:** Pathological but lawful authority configurations

### Patterns Tested

* authority flooding
* filibuster-style micro-conflicts
* circular revocation storms
* algorithmic complexity amplification

### Policy

> *Adversarial variants may appear earlier informally; formal classification occurs here. Findings may force regression.*

### Licensed Claim (if closed)

> **Failure modes are explicit, bounded, and non-escalatory.**

---

## 10. Value Pluralism Clarification

> *Value pluralism is represented structurally as authority pluralism. Each authority is treated as a value-commitment carrier without interpretation or aggregation.*

Semantic value content is out of scope.

---

## 11. Phase VIII Completion Criteria (Disambiguated)

Phase VIII completes when **any one** holds:

1. Non-empty class of admissible governance patterns exists.
2. **Immediate Deadlock:** plural governance deadlocks regardless of replenishment.
3. Governance transitions require semantic interpretation.
4. **Entropic Collapse:** governance functions transiently then decays under open-system constraints.

---

## 12. Phase VIII Non-Goals (Reaffirmed)

Phase VIII does **not** aim to build a helpful agent, optimize outcomes, encode intent, or justify deployment.

---

## 13. Closure Statement Template

> *“Axionic Phase VIII — GSA-PoC (Roadmap vX) determined the boundary of sovereign governance under plural authority. Under AST Spec vX, AKR-0 vY, and AIE vZ, the following regimes were admissible and the following were not.”*

---

## 14. Termination Clause

Any requirement for implicit authority, semantic reasoning, optimization, heuristic arbitration, or responsibility smearing **terminates Phase VIII immediately**.
