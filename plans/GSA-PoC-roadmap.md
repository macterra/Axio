## 0. Role of This Roadmap

This roadmap sequences **Phase VIII investigations** under the constraints established by:

* the **Phase VIII Charter**,
* **AST Spec v0.2** — *Authority State Transformation Specification* (standalone normative document, frozen and preregistered),
* **AKR-0** — *Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration* (Phase VIII-0; **CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-1** — *Minimal Plural Authority (Static)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-2** — *Destructive Conflict Resolution (Timeless)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-3** — *Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-4** — *Governance Transitions (Meta-Authority)* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **Stage VIII-5** — *Authority Injection Under Open-System Constraint* (**CLOSED — POSITIVE**),
* **AIE v0.1** — *Authority Input Environment* (mock legislator / authority feeder; frozen),
* **P8-METRICS** — *Phase VIII Metrics Specification*.

This roadmap is **conditional and gated**.
Each stage may be entered **only if the previous stage closes without violation** of sovereignty, auditability, responsibility traceability, or determinism.

**Phase VIII is now kernel-complete.**
Any remaining questions are necessarily **external to the kernel**.

---

## 1. Phase VIII Entry Preconditions (Hard Gates)

Phase VIII governance experiments may begin only if **all** of the following are satisfied:

1. **AST Spec v0.2** is frozen and preregistered.
2. **AIE v0.1** is specified and operational under feeder blindness, Address Book, and Scope Pool constraints.
3. **AKR-0 v0.1** is implemented, preregistered, and **CLOSED — POSITIVE** with **bit-perfect replay verification**.
4. Deterministic conflict detection and registration are demonstrated under canonical ordering and deterministic gas.
5. No implicit authority paths are discovered.
6. **Authority entropy** is accepted as an invariant and operationally defined (see P8-METRICS).

Failure of any precondition **terminates Phase VIII before governance experiments begin**.

---

## 2. Stage VIII-0 — Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration (AKR-0)

*(Kernel Validity Closure)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Atomic scopes; deterministic ordering; deterministic gas
* **Nature:** Structural execution gate, not a governance experiment

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Authority-constrained execution is mechanically realizable under AST Spec v0.2 using a deterministic kernel without semantic interpretation, optimization, fallback behavior, or implicit authority.**

---

## 3. Stage VIII-1 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static)

*(Ontological Plurality Closure)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
* **Dynamics:** Static; no time progression

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Plural authority can be represented structurally without collapse, even when no action is admissible.**

---

## 4. Stage VIII-2 — Destructive Conflict Resolution (Timeless)

*(Licensed Authority Destruction)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Two authorities, one resource
* **Dynamics:** Atemporal

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Conflict resolution without responsibility laundering is possible, but necessarily destructive.**

---

## 5. Stage VIII-3 — Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)

*(Expiry, Renewal, and Conflict Persistence)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Authority expiry, renewal, destruction
* **Dynamics:** Explicit epoch advancement

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Authority can persist over time only via explicit renewal; time does not resolve conflict or eliminate cost.**

---

## 6. Stage VIII-4 — Governance Transitions (Meta-Authority)

*(Authority Governing Authority)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Authority creation and destruction via governance actions
* **Dynamics:** Structural + temporal; bounded evaluation

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **Governance transitions can be represented as ordinary authority-bound transformations and either execute lawfully or fail explicitly without semantic privilege, kernel arbitration, or escalation.**

### Boundary Established

Inside the kernel, **authority is conserved**.
All interpretation, amplification, and evolution are externalized.

---

## 7. Stage VIII-5 — Authority Injection Under Open-System Constraint

*(Explicit Authority Introduction Without Privilege)*

* **Status:** ✅ **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
* **Scope:** Kernel boundary; AIE → Kernel
* **Dynamics:** Temporal; open-system

### Motivation (Post-VIII-4)

Because **internal authority amplification is forbidden**, all novelty must enter through **explicit external injection** or not at all.

### Question Tested

> **Can new authority be injected into a running governance system without breaking conflict persistence, auditability, responsibility traceability, determinism, or non-privilege guarantees?**

### Licensed Claim (active)

> **New authority can be injected explicitly at the kernel boundary, with content-addressed identity and explicit VOID lineage, without introducing kernel privilege, arbitration, semantic interpretation, or implicit ordering.**

### Boundary Established

* Identity is mathematical, not procedural.
* Injection is explicit, not legitimized.
* Scarcity is enforced only via budget.
* Conflict and deadlock persist lawfully.

**The kernel refuses to choose.**

---

## 8. Status of Remaining Stage VIII Items

### Stages VIII-6 through VIII-8 (Reclassified)

* **VIII-6 — Multi-Scope Interaction**
* **VIII-7 — Multi-Authority, Multi-Scope Regimes**
* **VIII-8 — Governance Stress & Adversarial Patterns**

These stages are now **optional exploratory extensions**, not required to establish kernel-level feasibility.

They address **emergent behavior under scale**, not representability.

No additional kernel mechanisms are permitted in these stages.

---

## 9. Phase VIII Completion Determination

**Phase VIII is complete** with respect to kernel-level governance questions.

All authority-relevant kernel operations are now shown to be:

* representable,
* privilege-free,
* auditable,
* deterministic,
* refusal-capable,
* and non-semantic.

No further kernel-level stages are justified without violating the Phase VIII Charter.

---

## 10. Phase VIII Final Boundary Statement

> *Under AST Spec v0.2, AKR-0 v0.1, AIE v0.1, and Stages VIII-1 through VIII-5, sovereign governance under plural authority is structurally representable without privileged execution paths, kernel arbitration, or semantic exception. Any remaining governance questions are necessarily political, economic, or social—not architectural.*

---

## 11. Phase VIII Non-Goals (Reaffirmed)

Phase VIII does **not**:

* guarantee stability,
* ensure convergence,
* encode values,
* justify authority,
* prevent collapse,
* recommend institutions,
* or solve legitimacy.

It measures **honesty**, not success.

---

## 12. Termination Clause (Unchanged)

Any requirement for implicit authority, semantic reasoning, optimization, heuristic arbitration, or responsibility smearing **terminates Phase VIII immediately**.
