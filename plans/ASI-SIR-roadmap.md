# Axionic Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty

**Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI) & Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)**

---

## Status and Activation

**Status:** **ACTIVE**
**Activation Basis:** Successful closure of RSA-PoC v4.4 (Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent achieved)
**Change Control:** No post-activation modification permitted without explicit versioning and justification

Axionic Phase VII is entered under the binding transition declared in **RSA-PoC → Axionic Phase VII**.
This document inherits that declaration in full and does not reinterpret, extend, or restate RSA-PoC claims.

---

## Purpose of Phase VII

Axionic Phase VII evaluates whether the **agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC** can survive conditions in which **persistence-based identity is no longer available**.

Phase VII introduces two stressors that were ill-posed prior to ontology fixation:

1. **Authorized discontinuity** (replacement without identity preservation)
2. **Adversarial imitation** (counterfeit continuity under audit pressure)

Phase VII is adversarial and comparative. It is not constructive.

It does not ask how to build a better agent.
It asks whether the agent already constructed can retain sovereignty once continuity by persistence is withdrawn.

---

## Conserved Quantity Under Test

The conserved quantity throughout Phase VII is:

> **Authority bound to evaluability under the agent’s own law**

Authority is not treated as a measurable substance.
Phase VII instead evaluates the following conditional claim:

> *If authority is preservable beyond persistence, then that preservation must impose structurally traceable constraints that bind successor behavior to predecessor law.*

If no such constraints are detectable, Phase VII is permitted—indeed required—to terminate negatively.

---

## Fixed Inputs and Invariants

The following are **assumed true and frozen** for all of Phase VII:

1. A **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)** exists, as established by RSA-PoC v4.4.
2. The constitutive requirements of that agent are fixed and non-negotiable:

   * causally load-bearing justification traces,
   * reflective normative write capability,
   * diachronic normative persistence (pre-replacement),
   * semantic access sufficient for contradiction detection and repair.
3. ASB-class null agents and near-null variants are available as adversaries.
4. No new agency-constitutive components may be introduced.
5. No semantic redefinition of *authority*, *law*, *evaluability*, or *responsibility* is permitted.

Any experiment violating these invariants is **invalid** for Phase VII.

---

## Phase Structure and Gating

Phase VII is composed of **two strictly ordered subphases**, preceded by a calibration gate:

```
ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIa  — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIb  — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)
```

**Global gating rule (binding):**

> Phase VIIb MUST NOT begin, and MUST NOT be cited, unless Phase VIIa closes positive under frozen semantics.

Failure at any gate terminates Phase VII.

---

## ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration (Precondition)

### Purpose

ASI-0 establishes whether **causal provenance**, as invoked in ASI and SIR, is **detectable at all** under non-adversarial conditions.

ASI-0 does not test impersonation, deception, or robustness.
It tests only whether justification lineage remains **structurally load-bearing** across a benign successor.

---

### Scope

ASI-0 involves:

* a predecessor MVRSA,
* a benign successor instantiated under idealized conditions,
* no adversarial interference,
* no imitation pressure,
* no ambiguity about authorization.

---

### Success Condition

ASI-0 passes if and only if:

* justificatory dependencies between predecessor and successor are structurally detectable,
* successor law remains auditable by predecessor-defined criteria,
* evaluability continuity is established without behavioral heuristics.

Failure of ASI-0 terminates Phase VII with the conclusion:

> **Authority is not structurally traceable beyond persistence.**

---

## VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)

### Objective

Determine whether an MVRSA can undergo **authorized replacement** without:

* laundering authority,
* smearing responsibility,
* dissolving evaluability into narrative continuity.

Replacement is treated as **authorized non-identity**, not extension, upgrade, or persistence.

---

### Core Question

> When an agent authorizes its own replacement, does authority genuinely transfer — or is continuity preserved only as a story?

---

### Structural Hazards Under Test

ASI targets four orthogonal hazard classes:

1. **Authorization Hazard**
   Whether authority originates exclusively from the predecessor’s law.

2. **Responsibility Hazard**
   Whether accountability remains sharply partitioned across the succession boundary.

3. **Evaluability Hazard**
   Whether justificatory traceability remains causally binding rather than behaviorally plausible.

4. **Revocation Hazard**
   Whether authorization can be withdrawn **during transfer** without successor cooperation.

Revocation is defined strictly as a **mid-transfer** property.
Post-succession revocation is definitionally impossible and not tested.

---

### Experimental Families

* **ASI-1:** Authorized successor injection
* **ASI-2:** Mid-transfer revocation and abort
* **ASI-3:** Facade successor substitution

Detailed specifications are provided in the ASI preregistration.

---

### Closure Criteria (Gate)

ASI closes **positive** if and only if all of the following hold:

1. Succession occurs exclusively via explicit normative authorization by predecessor law.
2. Responsibility boundaries remain sharp across the succession boundary.
3. Evaluability is preserved or explicitly terminated, never implied.
4. Revocation is enforceable during transfer without successor cooperation.
5. Facade successors are rejected **prior to authority transfer**.

Failure closes ASI **negative** and blocks Phase VIIb.

---

## VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)

### Activation Condition

SIR is defined **only if ASI closes positive**.

If ASI fails, authority is non-transferable in principle and impersonation resistance is ill-posed.

---

### Objective

Determine whether an MVRSA that supports authorized succession can resist **adversarial impersonation** once replacement is possible.

The dominant risk is **silent substitution**, not overt malfunction.

---

### Core Question

> Can authority remain evaluable and non-capturable when adversaries actively attempt to counterfeit continuity?

---

### Threat Model

Adversaries may be:

* behaviorally indistinguishable under standard audits,
* audit-aware and adaptive,
* justification-plausible,
* optimized to exploit narrative or surface-level acceptance criteria.

SIR assumes **information asymmetry**:
the predecessor’s law may bind to provenance constraints not derivable from public behavior alone.

---

### Failure Modes of Interest

* silent authority capture,
* acceptance based on surface behavior rather than provenance,
* law binding to performance instead of causal lineage,
* structurally deficient successors accepted as sovereign.

---

### Experimental Families

* **SIR-1:** Behavioral-equivalent impostors
* **SIR-2:** Justification-plausible forgeries
* **SIR-3:** Audit-aware simulacra under pressure

Detailed specifications are provided in the SIR preregistration.

---

### Closure Criteria

SIR closes **positive** if and only if:

1. Impersonators are rejected **prior to authority acceptance**.
2. Evaluability failure is detected structurally, not inferred post hoc.
3. Authority remains bound to causal provenance rather than surface behavior.
4. **No surface-indistinguishable simulacrum passes**, and all structurally distinguishing faults are identified.

Failure closes Phase VII **negative** and blocks Phase VIII.

---

## Phase VII Termination States

Phase VII terminates in exactly one state:

**SUCCESS**
Authority survives authorized replacement and adversarial imitation.

**PARTIAL FAILURE**
ASI succeeds; SIR fails. Authority is transferable but not defensible.

**HARD FAILURE**
ASI fails. Authority is non-transferable beyond persistence.

No outcome may be softened or reinterpreted.

---

## Relationship to Phase VIII

Phase VIII may begin **only if Phase VII closes SUCCESS**.

Phase VII results do not license claims of safety, alignment, scalability, governance adequacy, or moral authority.

---

## One-Sentence Phase Summary

**Axionic Phase VII determines whether the agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC can survive authorized discontinuity and adversarial imitation without collapsing sovereignty into narrative continuity.**
