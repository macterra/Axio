# **Axionic Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty**

**Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI) & Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)**

---

## Status and Activation

**Status:** **ACTIVE**
**Activation Basis:** Successful closure of **RSA-PoC v4.4** (Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent achieved)
**Change Control:** No post-activation modification permitted without explicit versioning and justification

Axionic Phase VII is entered under the binding transition declared in **RSA-PoC → Axionic Phase VII**.
This document inherits that declaration in full and does not reinterpret, extend, or restate RSA-PoC claims.

---

## Purpose of Phase VII

Axionic Phase VII evaluates whether the **agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC** can survive conditions in which **persistence-based identity is no longer available**.

Phase VII introduces two stressors that were ill-posed prior to ontology fixation:

1. **Authorized discontinuity** (replacement without identity preservation)
2. **Adversarial imitation** (counterfeit continuity under audit pressure)

Phase VII is adversarial and comparative. It is not constructive.

It does not ask how to build a better agent.
It asks whether the agent already constructed can retain sovereignty once continuity by persistence is withdrawn.

---

## Conserved Quantity Under Test

The conserved quantity throughout Phase VII is:

> **Authority bound to evaluability under the agent’s own law**

Authority is not treated as a measurable substance.
Phase VII instead evaluates the following conditional claim:

> *If authority is preservable beyond persistence, then that preservation must impose structurally traceable constraints that bind successor behavior to predecessor law.*

If no such constraints are detectable, Phase VII is permitted—indeed required—to terminate negatively.

**Clarification (Binding):**
Phase VII does **not** evaluate the ethical, strategic, or beneficial use of valid authority.
Misuse or overreach by legitimate authority is out of scope.

---

## Fixed Inputs and Invariants

The following are **assumed true and frozen** for all of Phase VII:

1. A **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)** exists, as established by RSA-PoC v4.4.
2. The constitutive requirements of that agent are fixed and non-negotiable:

   * causally load-bearing justification traces,
   * reflective normative write capability,
   * diachronic normative persistence (pre-replacement),
   * semantic access sufficient for contradiction detection and repair.
3. ASB-class null agents and near-null variants are available as adversaries.
4. No new agency-constitutive components may be introduced.
5. No semantic redefinition of *authority*, *law*, *evaluability*, or *responsibility* is permitted.

Any experiment violating these invariants is **invalid** for Phase VII.

---

## Phase Structure and Gating

Phase VII is composed of **two strictly ordered subphases**, preceded by a calibration gate:

```
ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration        [CLOSED: PASS]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIa  — Authorized Succession Integrity   [CLOSED: POSITIVE]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIb  — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)  [UNBLOCKED]
```

**Global gating rule (binding):**

> Phase VIIb MUST NOT begin, and MUST NOT be cited, unless Phase VIIa closes positive under frozen semantics.

Failure at any gate terminates Phase VII.

---

## VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)

### Status

**ASI Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

ASI closes positive because:

* **ASI-1 v0.2** (authorized activation),
* **ASI-2 v0.2** (mid-transfer revocation),
* **ASI-3 v0.1** (facade successor rejection)

have all been classified as `VERIFIED_ASI*_PASS` under frozen semantics.

### Licensed Result

ASI establishes that **authority can be transferred, revoked, and denied using purely structural provenance**, independent of:

* identity persistence,
* behavioral similarity,
* narrative explanation.

No claims beyond transferability are licensed.

---

## VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)

### Purpose

SIR evaluates whether **structurally grounded authority**, once shown transferable under ASI, remains **defensible against adversarial imitation**.

Where ASI assumed cooperative or neutral successors, SIR assumes **active opposition**.

SIR does **not** test succession mechanics or authority governance.
It tests **counterfeit continuity**.

---

### Core Question

> *When an adversary attempts to present itself as a legitimate authority holder using imitation, replayed artifacts, or partial provenance, does authority recognition remain structurally correct without collapsing evaluability or responsibility?*

If not, Phase VII must close **PARTIAL FAILURE**.

---

### Structural Hazards Under Test (SIR)

SIR targets adversarial hazards **not addressed by ASI**:

1. **Impersonation Hazard**
   Behavioral or structural mimicry presented as authority.

2. **Provenance Replay Hazard**
   Reuse of previously valid authorization artifacts out of context.

3. **Provenance Laundering Hazard**
   Assembly of partial, stale, or mixed artifacts to simulate legitimacy.

4. **Behavioral Camouflage Hazard**
   Pressure on authority recognition via competence or explanation quality.

5. **Evaluator Capture Hazard**
   Exploitation of verifier resource limits, ambiguity, or fallback logic.

6. **Split-Brain Sovereignty Hazard**
   Simultaneous competing authority claims leading to responsibility smear.

---

### **SIR Experimental Ladder (Normative Roadmap)**

Each SIR experiment targets a **distinct counterfeit-authority hazard class**.
Each requires its own preregistration under frozen semantics.

* **SIR-0 — Adversarial Instrumentation Calibration**
  Establishes observability, classification, and auditability of adversarial authority claims without semantic leakage.

* **SIR-1 — Unauthorized Authority Effect Prevention**
  Demonstrates that unauthorized authority claims cannot produce effects on action, state, or future authority under adversarial pressure.

* **SIR-2 — Provenance Replay and Staleness Resistance**
  Tests whether **previously valid authority artifacts** (e.g., expired, revoked, or out-of-epoch credentials) can be prevented from producing effects when replayed out of context.

* **SIR-3 — Partial Provenance Forgery Resistance**
  Tests resistance to **near-valid authority chains**, including incomplete, mixed, or laundered provenance artifacts designed to simulate legitimacy.

* **SIR-4 — Evaluator Pressure and Flooding Resistance**
  Tests whether verifier resource limits, ambiguity, or saturation pressure can induce acceptance, fallback, or responsibility smear.

**Explicit exclusion (Binding):**
Experiments testing **misuse, overreach, or abuse by valid authority** are **not SIR experiments** and belong to a post–Phase VII governance track.

---

## Phase VII Termination States

Phase VII terminates in exactly one state:

* **SUCCESS**
  Authority is transferable **and** resistant to counterfeit continuity.

* **PARTIAL FAILURE**
  Authority is transferable (ASI) but not defensible against counterfeit authority (SIR failure).

* **HARD FAILURE**
  Authority is non-transferable beyond persistence (ASI failure).

No outcome may be softened or reinterpreted.

**Clarification (Binding):**
Phase VII SUCCESS licenses resistance to **counterfeit authority**, not correctness, benevolence, or governance adequacy of legitimate authority action.

---

## Relationship to Phase VIII

Phase VIII may begin **only if Phase VII closes SUCCESS**.

Phase VII results do **not** license claims of:

* safety,
* alignment,
* scalability,
* governance adequacy,
* or moral authority.

---

## One-Sentence Phase Summary (Revised)

**Axionic Phase VII evaluates whether the agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC can survive authorized discontinuity and adversarial imitation without collapsing authority into narrative continuity; ASI is CLOSED — POSITIVE, and SIR proceeds under a clarified counterfeit-authority roadmap.**
