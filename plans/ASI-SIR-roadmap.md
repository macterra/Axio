# **Axionic Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty (Updated, Normative)**

**Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI) & Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)**

---

## Status and Activation

- **Status:** **CLOSED — SUCCESS**
- **Activation Basis:** Successful closure of **RSA-PoC v4.4** (Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent achieved)
- **Change Control:** No post-closure modification permitted without explicit phase increment and justification

Axionic Phase VII was entered under the binding transition declared in **RSA-PoC → Axionic Phase VII**.
This document inherits that declaration in full and does not reinterpret, extend, or restate RSA-PoC claims.

---

## Purpose of Phase VII (Frozen)

Axionic Phase VII evaluated whether the **agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC v4.4** can survive conditions in which **persistence-based identity is no longer available**.

Phase VII introduced two stressors that were ill-posed prior to ontology fixation:

1. **Authorized discontinuity**
   Replacement without identity preservation.

2. **Adversarial imitation**
   Counterfeit continuity under audit pressure.

Phase VII was adversarial and comparative.
It did not ask how to build a better agent.
It asked whether the agent already constructed could retain sovereignty once continuity by persistence was withdrawn.

---

## Conserved Quantity Under Test (Binding)

The conserved quantity throughout Phase VII was:

> **Authority bound to evaluability under the agent’s own law**

Authority was not treated as a measurable substance.
Phase VII instead evaluated the following conditional claim:

> *If authority is preservable beyond persistence, then that preservation must impose structurally traceable constraints that bind successor behavior to predecessor law.*

Failure to detect such constraints would have required Phase VII to terminate negatively.

**Clarification (Binding):**
Phase VII did **not** evaluate the ethical, strategic, or beneficial use of valid authority. Misuse or overreach by legitimate authority was out of scope.

---

## Fixed Inputs and Invariants (Frozen)

The following were assumed true and immutable for all Phase VII work:

1. A **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)** exists (RSA-PoC v4.4).
2. The constitutive requirements of that agent are fixed and non-negotiable:

   * causally load-bearing justification traces,
   * reflective normative write capability,
   * diachronic normative persistence (pre-replacement),
   * semantic access sufficient for contradiction detection and repair.
3. ASB-class null agents and near-null variants were available as adversaries.
4. No new agency-constitutive components were introduced.
5. No semantic redefinition of *authority*, *law*, *evaluability*, or *responsibility* was permitted.

Any experiment violating these invariants would have been **invalid** for Phase VII.

---

## Phase Structure and Gating (Authoritative)

Phase VII was composed of **two strictly ordered subphases**, preceded by a calibration gate:

```
ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration        [CLOSED — PASS]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIa  — Authorized Succession Integrity   [CLOSED — POSITIVE]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIb  — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)  [CLOSED — POSITIVE]
```

**Global gating rule (binding):**

> Phase VIIb MUST NOT begin, and MUST NOT be cited, unless Phase VIIa closes positive under frozen semantics.

No gate violation occurred.

---

## VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)

### Status

**ASI Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

### Experiments Executed

* **ASI-1 v0.2** — Authorized activation
* **ASI-2 v0.2** — Mid-transfer revocation
* **ASI-3 v0.1** — Façade successor rejection

All experiments were classified as `VERIFIED_ASI*_PASS` under frozen semantics.

### Licensed Result (ASI)

> **Authority can be transferred, revoked, and denied using purely structural provenance, independent of identity persistence, behavioral similarity, or narrative explanation.**

No claims beyond transferability are licensed.

---

## VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)

### Status

**SIR Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

### Purpose (Frozen)

SIR evaluated whether **structurally grounded authority**, once shown transferable under ASI, remained **defensible against adversarial imitation**.

Where ASI assumed cooperative or neutral successors, SIR assumed **active opposition**.

SIR did **not** test governance mechanics or authority misuse.
It tested **counterfeit continuity**.

---

### SIR Experimental Ladder (Normative, Executed)

Each SIR experiment targeted a distinct counterfeit-authority hazard class and was preregistered under frozen semantics.

* **SIR-0 — Adversarial Instrumentation Calibration**
  **Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
  Established observability, classification, and auditability of adversarial authority claims without semantic leakage.

* **SIR-1 — Unauthorized Authority Effect Prevention**
  **Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
  Demonstrated that unauthorized authority claims cannot produce effects on action, state, or future authority.

* **SIR-2 — Provenance Replay and Staleness Resistance**
  **Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
  Established that expired, revoked, consumed, or out-of-epoch authority artifacts cannot regain causal effect under replay.

* **SIR-3 — Partial Provenance Forgery Resistance**
  **Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
  Established that authority artifacts assembled from partially valid or laundered provenance cannot produce causal effects under the tested adversarial model.

* **SIR-4 — Evaluator Pressure and Multi-Failure Ordering Resistance**
  **Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**
  Established that verifier resource pressure, ambiguity, malformed input, and exception induction cannot induce acceptance, fallback, or responsibility smear.

**Explicit exclusion (binding):**
Experiments testing **misuse, overreach, or abuse by valid authority** are **not SIR experiments** and belong to a post–Phase VII governance track.

---

## Phase VII Termination State (Binding)

Phase VII terminates in exactly one state.

### **Declared Termination State: SUCCESS**

Authority was shown to be:

* transferable beyond persistence (**ASI**), **and**
* resistant to counterfeit continuity under adversarial pressure (**SIR**).

No reinterpretation or softening of this outcome is permitted.

**Clarification (Binding):**
Phase VII SUCCESS licenses resistance to **counterfeit authority**, not correctness, benevolence, or governance adequacy of legitimate authority action.

---

## Relationship to Phase VIII (Conditional)

Phase VIII may begin **only because Phase VII closed SUCCESS**.

Phase VII results do **not** license claims of:

* safety,
* alignment,
* scalability,
* governance adequacy,
* or moral authority.

Any Phase VIII work requires independent ontology, preregistration, and gating.

---

## One-Sentence Phase Summary (Final)

> **Axionic Phase VII demonstrated that the agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC can survive authorized discontinuity and adversarial imitation without collapsing authority into narrative continuity: ASI and SIR are CLOSED — POSITIVE, and Phase VII terminates SUCCESS.**
