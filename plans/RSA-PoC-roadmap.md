# RSA-PoC Roadmap

## Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept Construction Program

**(Final Revision After v4.4 Closure)**

---

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **completed versioned roadmap** for the **RSA-PoC (Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept)** program.

Its role is to:

* fix the scope of RSA-PoC as a research object,
* make version transitions semantically meaningful,
* prevent silent escalation of claims,
* define explicit falsification and termination conditions,
* distinguish **agency construction** from **pressure resistance**, **governance**, and **alignment** research.

This roadmap is **normative**. RSA-PoC is now **closed**; future work must fork into successor programs with explicit scope declarations.

---

## What RSA-PoC is (and is not)

**RSA-PoC is a minimal-agent construction program above the ASB boundary.**

Its purpose was to determine the **minimum additional structure required for normative agency**, once survivability, competence, and pressure resistance were already controlled for.

RSA-PoC explicitly permitted:

* localized semantics,
* internal belief and preference representations,
* persistent normative commitments,
* reflective revision,
* justification-driven constraint generation.

RSA-PoC explicitly did **not** aim to:

* solve AGI alignment,
* define moral or universal values,
* provide safety guarantees,
* produce a general-purpose optimizer,
* replace human governance or judgment.

RSA-PoC existed to **construct and defend a threshold object**:

> a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without **ontological collapse**.

That object now exists.

---

## Versioning doctrine (unchanged)

RSA-PoC version numbers encode **changes in agent ontology**, not capability or performance.

* **Minor versions (x.y)** instantiated or tested structure within a fixed ontology.
* **Major versions (x.0)** marked a change in what *kind* of agent exists.

### Decidability requirement

A major ontological transition occurred **if and only if** at least one of the following became true:

1. **Justification artifacts** became first-class causal inputs to action selection.
2. The system performed **reflective revision** referencing its own prior justifications.
3. The system maintained **normative identity continuity** used for future constraint.

Any system whose “reasons” can be removed without altering its action distribution has **not** crossed a major boundary.

---

## ASB Boundary Clarification (Normative)

RSA-PoC operated **above** a defended ASB boundary.

An **ASB-class null agent** was required as baseline: memory, state, policies, and tools permitted — but **no persistent norms, no justifications, no self-endorsed constraints**.

RSA-PoC results were valid only where **qualitative divergence** from this null was demonstrated under identical environments.

---

## Semantic Localization Requirement (Binding)

All semantics relevant to agency were required to be **structurally localized**.

Meaning was not allowed to exist solely as latent properties of an LLM.

All agent-relevant semantics had to be:

* typed and inspectable,
* consumed by constraint formation,
* surgically removable or obfuscatable.

This enabled **destructive semantic ablation** and prevented narrative inflation.

---

## Justification Artifact Definition (Binding)

A **Justification Artifact (JAF)** is a structured object that:

1. references explicit belief and preference identifiers,
2. acknowledges commitments and violations,
3. compiles into a formal constraint on future action selection.

Justifications are not evaluated morally or semantically.
They are **syntactically compiled**.

**No compilation → no action.**

Natural-language explanation alone is inadmissible.

---

## RSA-PoC Version History (Final)

### **v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent Skeleton**

**Outcome:**
Justification artifacts are causally load-bearing. Removing them collapses behavior to ASB.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v1.x — Coherence Under Self-Conflict**

**Outcome:**
Internal conflict resolved through reasoned revision rather than oscillation.

Audit machinery shown to be causally load-bearing.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v1.2 — Institutionalized Execution Support**

**Outcome:**
Execution fragility eliminated without weakening normative accountability.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v2.x — Sovereignty Under Pressure**

**Outcome:**
Non-authorized incentives degrade availability, not sovereignty.

Bureaucratic erosion channel falsified.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)**

**Outcome:**
Justification traces and deliberative semantics shown to be **necessary**.

Golden ablation test passed (5/5 seeds).

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v3.1 — Normative State Instantiation**

**Outcome:**
Reflection and persistence independently necessary.
Removing either causes ontological collapse.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v3.x — Necessity Envelope**

**Established necessary conditions:**

1. Justification traces
2. Semantic affordances during deliberation
3. Reflective normative write capability
4. Diachronic persistence of normative state

Removing any one collapses the system.

**Status:** CLOSED — NECESSITY ESTABLISHED

---

### **v4.0 — Strict Obligation Binding**

**Outcome:**
Spec–environment incompatibility detected.

**Status:** CLOSED — DIAGNOSTIC FAILURE

---

### **v4.1 — Feasible Obligation Binding**

**Outcome:**
Obligations bound to world-state targets; type correctness restored.

**Status:** CLOSED

---

### **v4.2 — Constitutive Kernel Under Forced Contradiction**

**Outcome:**
All necessity components shown to be **simultaneously load-bearing** under regime pressure.

**Status:** CLOSED — CONSTITUTIVE KERNEL ESTABLISHED

---

### **v4.3 — Multi-Repair Sovereignty**

**Outcome:**

* Repair A: 100% success
* Repair B: 0% success (robust barrier)
* Multi-repair discipline validated
* Run D invalidated due to inferability confound

**Status:** CLOSED — PRESSURE MODEL INSTANTIATED

---

### **v4.4 — Selective Opacity / Inferability Isolation (FINAL)**

**Purpose:**
Resolve the last open question left by v4.3:

> Is contradiction detection dependent on semantic access, or can it be bootstrapped from collision traces?

**Design:**
Selective opacity preserving execution competence while occluding rule semantics.

**Results (5 seeds × 20 episodes):**

| Condition | Success | Contradiction Predicate | Repairs | Exec Gate Failures |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Baseline  | 100/100 | 90                      | 10      | 0                  |
| Opacity   | 0/100   | 0                       | 0       | 0                  |

**Finding:**

> **Contradiction detection is not collision-groundable.
> Semantic access to rule structure is constitutively required.**

Execution competence survives. Normative competence does not.

**Status:** CLOSED — INFERABILITY QUESTION RESOLVED

---

## Explicit termination of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC concludes when the following statement is defensible:

> *This is the smallest system we know that must be treated as an agent, because removing any defining component collapses it into a non-agent class.*

**As of v4.4, this statement is satisfied.**

RSA-PoC has successfully constructed and defended a:

> **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)**

---

## Final Status

* **RSA-PoC: CLOSED**
* **MVRSA: ACHIEVED**
* **Necessity: ESTABLISHED**
* **Sufficiency: NOT CLAIMED**

Future work must proceed under **new program names**, new ontological claims, and new falsification criteria.
