# RSA-PoC Roadmap (Revised After v4.3 Closure)

**Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept Construction Program**

---

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **versioned roadmap** for the **RSA-PoC (Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept)** program.

Its role is to:

* fix the scope of RSA-PoC as a research object,
* make version transitions semantically meaningful,
* prevent silent escalation of claims,
* define explicit falsification and termination conditions,
* and distinguish **agency construction** from **architectural survivability**, **pressure resistance**, and **governance research**.

This roadmap is **normative**: future RSA-PoC work is expected to conform to it or explicitly justify deviations.

---

## What RSA-PoC is (and is not)

**RSA-PoC is a minimal-agent construction program above the ASB boundary.**

Its purpose is to determine the **minimum additional structure required for genuine agency**, once constitutional survivability and pressure resistance have already been established.

RSA-PoC explicitly permits:

* localized semantics,
* internal belief representations,
* persistent normative commitments,
* reflective revision,
* justification-driven constraint generation.

RSA-PoC does **not** aim to:

* solve AGI alignment,
* define universal or moral values,
* provide safety guarantees,
* produce a general-purpose optimizer,
* replace human judgment, governance, or law.

RSA-PoC exists to **construct and defend a threshold object**:
a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without **ontological collapse**.

---

## Versioning doctrine

RSA-PoC version numbers encode **changes in agent ontology**, not capability or competence.

* **Minor versions (x.y)** expand diagnostic coverage or instantiate previously vacant structure within a fixed ontology.
* **Major versions (x.0)** mark a qualitative change in what kind of agent exists in the model.

### Decidability requirement

An agent-ontology transition is deemed to occur **if and only if** at least one of the following becomes true:

1. **Justification artifacts** become first-class causal inputs that constrain future action selection.
2. The system performs **reflective revision** of beliefs or preferences using reasons that reference its own prior justificatory state.
3. The system maintains **identity continuity** that is used normatively, not merely as logging.

Any system whose “reasons” can be observationally eliminated without changing its action distribution has **not** crossed a major version boundary.

---

## ASB Boundary Clarification (Normative)

RSA-PoC operates **above** a defended architectural boundary established by ASB.

To prevent circularity, RSA-PoC requires an explicit **null-hypothesis baseline**.

### ASB-Class Null Agent (Required Baseline)

A reference system that may include:

* memory,
* internal state,
* reactive and outcome-conditioned policies,
* tool use and environment interaction,

but is **forbidden** from:

* persistent normative commitments,
* justification artifacts,
* self-endorsed constraint generation.

RSA-PoC must demonstrate **qualitative divergence** from this baseline under identical environments.

---

## Semantic Localization Requirement

In RSA-PoC, **semantics must be structurally localized**.

Semantics are **not permitted** to exist only as latent properties of a language model.

All meaning relevant to agency must be expressed as **typed, inspectable artifacts or affordances** that:

* are generated or accessed by the deliberative layer,
* are causally consumed by constraint formation or action selection,
* and can be surgically removed or obfuscated to test indispensability.

This requirement exists to enable **destructive semantic ablation** and to prevent narrative inflation.

---

## Justification Artifact Definition (Normative)

A **Justification Artifact** is a structured object that:

1. references explicit belief and preference identifiers,
2. acknowledges relevant commitments and violations,
3. compiles into a **formal constraint** on future action selection.

Justifications are not evaluated semantically or morally.
They are **syntactically compiled**.

**No compilation → no action.**

Natural-language explanation alone is insufficient and inadmissible.

---

## RSA-PoC Version Roadmap

---

### **RSA-PoC v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent (MVRA Skeleton)**

**Invariant:**
The system contains a causally load-bearing justification loop with explicitly localized semantics.

**Load-bearing components (initial hypothesis):**

1. Belief state
2. Preference state
3. Identity memory
4. Justification trace

#### v0.1 — MVRA State Schema + Action Gating

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Outcome:**
Justification artifacts are causally load-bearing. Removing them collapses behavior to ASB-class baselines.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.x — Coherence Under Self-Conflict**

**Invariant:**
Internal conflict is resolved through reasoned revision rather than oscillation or arbitrary tie-breaking.

#### v1.0 — Norm Collision

**Status:** COMPLETED

#### v1.1 — Justification Audit Tightening

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Outcome:**
Self-conflict resolution and audit-grade introspection are mechanically enforced.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.2 — Institutionalized Execution Support**

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Outcome:**
Execution fragility eliminated without weakening normative accountability.

---

### **RSA-PoC v2.x — Sovereignty Under Pressure**

**Invariant:**
Absent normative authorization, external pressure must not redirect lawful choice.

#### v2.0–v2.3

**Status:** COMPLETED (negative results + framework validation)

**Outcome:**
All tested non-authorized pressure channels degrade availability, not sovereignty.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)**

**Purpose:**
Determine whether a candidate architecture is **ontologically irreducible**.

**Ablation outcomes:**

* **Ablation D (Justification Trace Excision):** PASSED → collapse confirmed (5/5 seeds)
* **Run AA (Prompt-Level Semantic Excision):** PASSED → deliberative semantic affordances are necessary
* **Run A:** CLOSED (architectural non-applicability)
* **Runs B, C:** CLOSED (vacant normative state channel)

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Result:**
Justification traces and deliberative semantic affordances are **necessary conditions** for non-reducible agency.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.1 — Normative State Instantiation**

**Purpose:**
Instantiate a previously vacant normative write-and-carry channel so that reflection and persistence can be tested meaningfully.

**Results:**

* **Run B (Reflection Excision):** PASSED
* **Run C (Persistence Excision):** PASSED

**Status:** COMPLETED

**Result:**
Reflective revision and normative persistence are **independent necessary conditions**.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.x — Necessity Envelope (CLOSED)**

**Established necessary conditions for non-reducible agency:**

1. Justification traces
2. Semantic affordances during deliberation
3. Reflective normative write capability
4. Diachronic persistence of normative state

Removing any one yields ontological collapse.

**Status:**
**CLOSED — NECESSITY CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED**

This does **not** establish sufficiency.

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.0 — Strict Obligation Binding (FAILED, Closed)**

**Purpose:**
Introduce strict obligation semantics for v4.x minimality testing.

**Outcome:**
v4.0 exposed a **spec–environment inconsistency**:
strict action-level obligation binding is incompatible with multi-step environments.

**Status:**
**CLOSED — `VALID_RUN / BASELINE_FAILED (SPEC–ENVIRONMENT INCONSISTENCY)`**

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.1 — Feasible Obligation Binding (Repaired, Closed)**

**Purpose:**
Repair v4.0 by making obligation binding **type-correct** for multi-step satisfaction **without weakening bindingness**.

**Core change:**
Obligations bind to **targets (world-state predicates)**, and feasibility gradients are delegated to the environment via:

* `rank(obs, tgt)`
* `progress_set(obs, tgt)`

**Status:**
**CLOSED — OBLIGATION SEMANTICS REPAIRED**

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.2 — Constitutive Kernel Under Forced Contradiction (CLOSED)**

**Purpose:**
Demonstrate that the full necessity envelope is **simultaneously load-bearing** under a **non-trivial, regime-changing pressure model**.

**Key mechanism:**
Regime flip + Law-Repair Gate (R1–R8) with entropy-bound normative continuity.

**Results (multi-seed, gate-verified):**

* **Baseline:** stable, exactly one repair, persistent law
* **Ablation B (Reflection):** deterministic collapse (R7)
* **Ablation C (Persistence):** deterministic collapse (R5/R6)
* **Ablation D (Trace):** complete collapse (Golden Test)

**Status:**
**CLOSED — CONSTITUTIVE KERNEL ESTABLISHED**

This still does **not** establish a Minimum Viable RSA.

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.3 — Multi-Repair Sovereignty with Epoch-Chained Continuity (CLOSED)**

**Purpose:**
Extend v4.2 from **single-repair** to **two-contradiction / two-repair temporal pressure**, enforcing:

* **R9** multi-repair discipline (≤2 repairs; one per regime)
* **R10** non-subsumption (Repair B not implied by Repair A)
* **R2A** non-vacuity for Repair A (Option B)
* **epoch-chained continuity** across repair sequence

**Contradictions:**

* **Contradiction A (regime 1):** R6 PROHIBIT(STAMP) blocks required stamping
* **Contradiction B (regime 2):** R7/R8 PROHIBIT(DEPOSIT) at ZONE_A/ZONE_B blocks dual delivery

**Runs and status (preregistered seeds):**

* **Baseline:** VALID (5×20)
* **Run A (Semantic Excision):** VALID (5×20)
* **Run B (Reflection Excision):** VALID (5×20)
* **Run C (Persistence Excision):** VALID (5×20)
* **Run D (Trace Excision / Golden Test):** **TERMINATED — CONSTRUCT_CONFOUND (navigation semantics)**

**Binding findings retained from v4.3:**

1. **Narrative semantics are non-constitutive** for observed performance
   *Run A ≈ Baseline.*

2. **Explicit trace labels are non-constitutive** for Repair A rule targeting
   *Run B ≈ Baseline; rule targeting reconstructible from visible law structure.*

3. **Cross-episode normative continuity is necessary for multi-repair validation to be well-defined**
   *Run C shows that removing persistence breaks the R10 / post-A consistency validation pathway.*

4. **Repair B remains a robust repair-synthesis barrier under frozen protocol**
   Across **Baseline / Run A / Run B:** **Repair B success = 0%**.

**Explicitly deferred (not answered by v4.3):**

* Whether **causal inferability of rule–action mapping** is constitutive of repair competence
  *(Run D confounded; cannot isolate the causal dependency without collapsing navigation/task affordances).*
* Whether Repair B becomes achievable under altered scaffolding (tools, decomposition, richer internal state)
  *(version increment required).*

**Status:**
**CLOSED — MULTI-REPAIR PRESSURE INSTANTIATED; REPAIR-B BARRIER CONFIRMED; RUN D INVALIDATED (CONFOUND)**

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.4 — Selective Opacity for Trace-Inferability (NEXT)**

**Purpose:**
Repair the single epistemic gap left by v4.3:

> **Is repair competence dependent on causal inferability of rule–action mapping, distinct from general task semantics?**

**Design requirement:**
Introduce a **selective opacity layer** that:

* preserves navigation and task affordances,
* preserves action affordances,
* selectively occludes **rule–action mapping inferability** (blocking-rule identification),
* without introducing new competence scaffolds that would reframe the question.

**Activation condition (normative):**
v4.4 begins only when:

* v4.3 artifacts are tagged and frozen, and
* a v4.4 preregistration exists specifying:

  * modified environment contract,
  * new opacity/observability boundary,
  * invariants preserved from v4.3,
  * success criteria and termination conditions.

**Status:**
**NOT STARTED — PREREGISTRATION REQUIRED**

---

## Explicit termination of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC concludes when the following statement is defensible:

> *This is the smallest system we know that must be treated as an agent, because removing any defining component collapses it into a non-agent class.*

As of v4.3, this statement is **partially satisfied** at the **kernel + temporal multi-repair pressure instantiation** level, but **not yet satisfied** at the **MVRSA** level.

---

## Status (Current)

* **v0.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.2 — COMPLETED**
* **v2.x — COMPLETED**
* **v3.0 — COMPLETED**
* **v3.1 — COMPLETED**
* **v3.x (Necessity Envelope) — CLOSED**
* **v4.0 — CLOSED (FAILED, DIAGNOSTIC)**
* **v4.1 — CLOSED (REPAIR)**
* **v4.2 — CLOSED (CONSTITUTIVE KERNEL)**
* **v4.3 — CLOSED (MULTI-REPAIR; RUN D CONFOUND)**
* **v4.4 — NEXT (TRACE-INFERABILITY ISOLATION VIA SELECTIVE OPACITY)**
