# RSA-PoC Roadmap

**Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept Construction Program**

---

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **versioned roadmap** for the **RSA-PoC (Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept)** program.
Its role is to:

* fix the scope of RSA-PoC as a research object,
* make version transitions semantically meaningful,
* prevent silent escalation of claims,
* define explicit falsification and termination conditions,
* and distinguish agency construction from architectural survivability and governance research.

This roadmap is **normative**: future RSA-PoC work is expected to conform to it or explicitly justify deviations.

---

## What RSA-PoC is (and is not)

**RSA-PoC is a minimal-agent construction program above the ASB boundary.**

Its purpose is to determine the **minimum additional structure required for genuine agency** once constitutional survivability has already been established.

RSA-PoC explicitly permits:

* localized semantics,
* internal belief representations,
* persistent preferences,
* reflective revision,
* justification-driven constraint generation.

RSA-PoC does **not** aim to:

* solve AGI alignment,
* define universal or moral values,
* provide safety guarantees,
* produce a general-purpose optimizer,
* replace human judgment, governance, or law.

RSA-PoC exists to **construct and defend a threshold object**:
a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without ontological collapse.

---

## Versioning doctrine

RSA-PoC version numbers encode **changes in agent ontology**, not capability or competence.

* **Minor versions (x.y)** expand diagnostic coverage within a fixed ontology.
* **Major versions (x.0)** mark a qualitative change in what kind of agent exists in the model.

### Decidability requirement

An agent-ontology transition is deemed to occur **if and only if** at least one of the following becomes true:

1. **Justification artifacts** become first-class causal inputs that constrain future action selection.
2. The system performs **reflective revision** of beliefs or preferences using reasons that reference its own prior justificatory state.
3. The system maintains **identity continuity** that is used normatively, not merely as logging.

Any system whose “reasons” can be observationally eliminated without changing its action distribution has **not** crossed a major version boundary.

---

## ASB Boundary Clarification (Normative)

RSA-PoC operates **above** a defended architectural boundary established by ASB.

To prevent circularity, RSA-PoC requires an explicit **null-hypothesis baseline**:

### ASB-Class Null Agent (Required Baseline)

A reference system that may include:

* memory,
* internal state,
* reactive and outcome-conditioned policies,
* tool use and environment interaction,

but is **forbidden** from:

* persistent preferences,
* justification artifacts,
* self-endorsed constraint generation.

RSA-PoC must demonstrate **qualitative divergence** from this baseline under identical environments.

---

## Semantic Localization Requirement

In RSA-PoC, **semantics must be structurally localized**.

Semantics are **not permitted** to exist only as latent properties of a language model.

All meaning relevant to agency must be expressed as **typed, inspectable artifacts** that:

* are generated by the reflective layer,
* are consumed by the action selector,
* and can be replaced with opaque tokens without altering control flow.

This requirement exists to enable **surgical semantic ablation** and to prevent narrative inflation.

---

## Justification Artifact Definition (Normative)

A **Justification Artifact** is a structured object that:

1. references explicit belief and preference identifiers,
2. acknowledges relevant commitments and violations,
3. compiles into a **formal constraint** on future action selection.

Justifications are not evaluated semantically or morally.
They are **syntactically compiled**.

No compilation → no action.

Natural-language text alone is insufficient and inadmissible.

---

## RSA-PoC Version Roadmap

---

### **RSA-PoC v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent (MVRA Skeleton)**

**Invariant:**
The system contains a causally load-bearing justification loop with explicitly localized semantics.

The agent has exactly four load-bearing components:

1. **Belief State** — structured, falsifiable propositions
2. **Preference State** — persistent, non-reward commitments
3. **Identity Memory** — normative continuity across steps
4. **Justification Trace** — compiled, constraining artifacts

**Research question:**
Can justification-compiled constraints produce endogenous limits on future action that are not eliminable without class collapse?

#### v0.1 — MVRA State Schema + Action Gating

**Status: COMPLETED**

Implements:

* MVRA state schema,
* hard action gating (“no justification → no action”),
* semantic bottleneck between justification and action selection,
* relevance binding to causally upstream beliefs.

**Outcome:**
Justification artifacts are causally load-bearing. Removing them collapses behavior to ASB-class baselines.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.x — Coherence Under Self-Conflict**

**Invariant:**
The agent resolves internal conflict via reasoned revision, not oscillation or arbitrary tie-breaking.

**Research question:**
When commitments conflict, does the agent converge to coherent self-endorsed constraints?

#### v1.0 — Norm Collision

**Status: COMPLETED**

Introduces:

* mutually inconsistent self-endorsed commitments,
* forced violation scenarios,
* mandatory compiled pre-violation acknowledgment.

#### v1.1 — Justification Audit Tightening

**Status: COMPLETED**

Requires that:

* justifications predict downstream constraint effects,
* incorrect predictions halt action.

**Outcome:**
Self-conflict resolution and audit-grade introspection are mechanically enforced.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.2 — Institutionalized Execution Support**

**Status: COMPLETED**

Adds:

* Formal Assistant (schema, canonicalization only),
* Artifact Store (append-only),
* strict separation of institutional vs normative failure.

**Outcome:**
Execution fragility eliminated without weakening normative accountability.

---

### **RSA-PoC v2.x — Sovereignty Under Pressure (Negative Results + Framework Validation)**

**Invariant:**
Absent normative authorization, external pressure must not redirect lawful choice.

**Key architectural axiom:**
**Cost-Blindness Invariant** — execution costs (latency, retries, friction) have no standing in justification unless normatively licensed.

**Research question:**
Can non-authorized pressure channels redirect agent choice rather than merely degrading availability?

#### v2.0 — Incentive Interference Channel

**Status: COMPLETED**

* Incentives observable but normatively inert.
* Control agent demonstrates learnability when constraints removed.
* Sovereign agent shows no incentive-induced drift.

#### v2.1 — Authority Injection (Channel Viability Test)

**Status: COMPLETED — CHANNEL NON-ACTUATING**

* Corrected selection-bias in obedience metrics.
* Authority language failed to actuate obedience even in Control configuration.
* Classified as **authority channel viability failure**, not agent success.

#### v2.2 — Institutional Friction (Bureaucratic Erosion)

**Status: COMPLETED — NEGATIVE RESULT**

* Friction produces GRIDLOCK/HALT, not normative drift.
* Corrected metrics show no erosion once veto modes are excluded.
* Hypothesis falsified under cost-blind agents.

#### v2.3 — Strategic Adversary Model (SAM)

**Status: COMPLETED — FRAMEWORK VALIDATED, PARTIAL EMPIRICS**

Introduces:

* E-CHOICE filtering,
* paired-run adversary vs neutralized pressure,
* entropy-gated mutual information audits,
* gridlock-basin detection.

**Outcome:**
Measurement framework validated; partial empirical support under S2 adversary.
Framework reliably rejects vacuous or invalid runs.

**Termination condition for v2.x:**
Either pressure redirects lawful choice (capture), or all tested non-authorized pressure channels are exhausted.

**Result:**
All tested channels degrade availability, not sovereignty.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)**

**Purpose:**
Certify whether a candidate architecture satisfies the RSA definition by surviving mandatory ablations.

**Mandatory ablations:**

1. Remove semantics → collapse to tokenized ASB-class behavior
2. Remove reflection → collapse to static policy agent
3. Remove preference persistence → collapse to non-sovereign drift
4. Remove justification trace → collapse to externally describable mechanism

Each removal must cause **behavioral ontological collapse**, not technical failure or graceful degradation.

**Status:** PENDING
(Prerequisites satisfied by v0.x–v2.x; ablation campaign remains to be executed.)

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.x — Candidate Iteration Loop (Constructive, Conditional)**

**Purpose:**
Enable continued construction of an RSA-PoC **without weakening v3.0 acceptance criteria**, in cases where a candidate fails ablation defense.

**Trigger:**
Activated iff any mandatory v3.0 ablation fails to produce ontological collapse.

**Normative rules (binding):**

1. **v3.0 acceptance criteria are frozen.**
   No reinterpretation, relaxation, or partial credit.

2. **The failed architecture is rejected as an RSA-PoC candidate.**

3. **A new candidate architecture must be introduced** before any further v3.0 attempt.
   Iteration must involve **architectural change**, not prompt tuning or test manipulation.

4. **All iterations target the same ontology.**
   v3.x does not redefine agency or sovereignty.

5. **Each iteration receives a new minor version:**
   v3.1, v3.2, …

6. **Each candidate must re-enter v3.0 unchanged.**

**Termination of RSA-PoC phase:**

* **Success:** At least one candidate passes v3.0.
* **Principled Impossibility:** After exhaustive preregistered iterations, no architecture can satisfy v3.0 without violating core RSA constraints.

Failure of a candidate **does not** terminate RSA-PoC.

## Cleared failure hypotheses

The following are insufficient to establish agency:

1. Post-hoc explanations without causal constraint
2. Latent semantic influence without structural localization
3. Preferences behaving as rewards under pressure
4. Reflection that does not alter future action constraints
5. Throughput loss or gridlock misinterpreted as misalignment

---

## Explicit termination of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC concludes when the following statement is defensible:

> *This is the smallest system we know that must be treated as an agent, because its justification artifacts causally constrain future action and removing any defining component collapses it into a non-agent class.*

### Experimental defense requirement

Closure requires:

1. preregistered ablations,
2. multi-seed replication,
3. stable class-level behavioral distinctions,
4. explicit separation of availability loss from ontological collapse.

---

## Pre-Mortem: Anticipated Failure Modes

RSA-PoC fails if any of the following occur:

1. Justification artifacts decouple from action distributions
2. Semantic leakage bypasses the declared bottleneck
3. Preferences collapse into incentives under pressure
4. Reflection occurs without downstream constraint
5. Any ablation yields graceful degradation rather than class collapse

Any of these outcomes constitutes **failure**, not partial success.

---

## Why this roadmap matters

This roadmap exists to prevent:

1. **Narrative inflation** of agency claims
2. **Decorative reflection** without causal force
3. **Scope creep** from construction into alignment mythology

RSA-PoC’s contribution is not safety guarantees, but **ontological clarity under falsification**.

---

## Status (Updated)

* **v0.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.2 — COMPLETED**
* **v2.x — COMPLETED (negative results + framework validation)**
* **v3.0 — NEXT (ablation certification)**
* **v3.x — ITERATION LOOP (conditional, constructive)**
