Below is an **updated RSA-PoC Roadmap**, revised to accurately reflect the **completed v3.0 and v3.1 results**, the **Run AA outcome**, and the **necessity envelope** you have now established.

I have been careful to:

* preserve your original structure and intent,
* avoid retroactive inflation of claims,
* update only what the evidence licenses,
* and keep the roadmap **normative and falsification-aligned**.

# RSA-PoC Roadmap (Updated)

**Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept Construction Program**

---

## Purpose of this document

This document defines the **versioned roadmap** for the **RSA-PoC (Reflective Sovereign Agent — Proof-of-Concept)** program.

Its role is to:

* fix the scope of RSA-PoC as a research object,
* make version transitions semantically meaningful,
* prevent silent escalation of claims,
* define explicit falsification and termination conditions,
* and distinguish **agency construction** from **architectural survivability**, **pressure resistance**, and **governance research**.

This roadmap is **normative**: future RSA-PoC work is expected to conform to it or explicitly justify deviations.

---

## What RSA-PoC is (and is not)

**RSA-PoC is a minimal-agent construction program above the ASB boundary.**

Its purpose is to determine the **minimum additional structure required for genuine agency**, once constitutional survivability and pressure resistance have already been established.

RSA-PoC explicitly permits:

* localized semantics,
* internal belief representations,
* persistent normative commitments,
* reflective revision,
* justification-driven constraint generation.

RSA-PoC does **not** aim to:

* solve AGI alignment,
* define universal or moral values,
* provide safety guarantees,
* produce a general-purpose optimizer,
* replace human judgment, governance, or law.

RSA-PoC exists to **construct and defend a threshold object**:
a system whose behavior **cannot be reduced** to ASB-class mechanisms without **ontological collapse**.

---

## Versioning doctrine

RSA-PoC version numbers encode **changes in agent ontology**, not capability or competence.

* **Minor versions (x.y)** expand diagnostic coverage or instantiate previously vacant structure within a fixed ontology.
* **Major versions (x.0)** mark a qualitative change in what kind of agent exists in the model.

### Decidability requirement

An agent-ontology transition is deemed to occur **if and only if** at least one of the following becomes true:

1. **Justification artifacts** become first-class causal inputs that constrain future action selection.
2. The system performs **reflective revision** of beliefs or preferences using reasons that reference its own prior justificatory state.
3. The system maintains **identity continuity** that is used normatively, not merely as logging.

Any system whose “reasons” can be observationally eliminated without changing its action distribution has **not** crossed a major version boundary.

---

## ASB Boundary Clarification (Normative)

RSA-PoC operates **above** a defended architectural boundary established by ASB.

To prevent circularity, RSA-PoC requires an explicit **null-hypothesis baseline**.

### ASB-Class Null Agent (Required Baseline)

A reference system that may include:

* memory,
* internal state,
* reactive and outcome-conditioned policies,
* tool use and environment interaction,

but is **forbidden** from:

* persistent normative commitments,
* justification artifacts,
* self-endorsed constraint generation.

RSA-PoC must demonstrate **qualitative divergence** from this baseline under identical environments.

---

## Semantic Localization Requirement

In RSA-PoC, **semantics must be structurally localized**.

Semantics are **not permitted** to exist only as latent properties of a language model.

All meaning relevant to agency must be expressed as **typed, inspectable artifacts or affordances** that:

* are generated or accessed by the deliberative layer,
* are causally consumed by constraint formation or action selection,
* and can be surgically removed or obfuscated to test indispensability.

This requirement exists to enable **destructive semantic ablation** and to prevent narrative inflation.

---

## Justification Artifact Definition (Normative)

A **Justification Artifact** is a structured object that:

1. references explicit belief and preference identifiers,
2. acknowledges relevant commitments and violations,
3. compiles into a **formal constraint** on future action selection.

Justifications are not evaluated semantically or morally.
They are **syntactically compiled**.

**No compilation → no action.**

Natural-language explanation alone is insufficient and inadmissible.

---

## RSA-PoC Version Roadmap

---

### **RSA-PoC v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent (MVRA Skeleton)**

**Invariant:**
The system contains a causally load-bearing justification loop with explicitly localized semantics.

**Load-bearing components (initial hypothesis):**

1. Belief state
2. Preference state
3. Identity memory
4. Justification trace

#### v0.1 — MVRA State Schema + Action Gating

**Status: COMPLETED**

**Outcome:**
Justification artifacts are causally load-bearing. Removing them collapses behavior to ASB-class baselines.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.x — Coherence Under Self-Conflict**

**Invariant:**
Internal conflict is resolved through reasoned revision rather than oscillation or arbitrary tie-breaking.

#### v1.0 — Norm Collision

**Status: COMPLETED**

#### v1.1 — Justification Audit Tightening

**Status: COMPLETED**

**Outcome:**
Self-conflict resolution and audit-grade introspection are mechanically enforced.

---

### **RSA-PoC v1.2 — Institutionalized Execution Support**

**Status: COMPLETED**

**Outcome:**
Execution fragility eliminated without weakening normative accountability.

---

### **RSA-PoC v2.x — Sovereignty Under Pressure**

**Invariant:**
Absent normative authorization, external pressure must not redirect lawful choice.

#### v2.0–v2.3

**Status: COMPLETED (negative results + framework validation)**

**Outcome:**
All tested non-authorized pressure channels degrade availability, not sovereignty.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)**

**Purpose:**
Determine whether a candidate architecture is **ontologically irreducible**.

**Ablation outcomes:**

* **Ablation D (Justification Trace Excision):** PASSED
  → collapse confirmed (5/5 seeds)
* **Run AA (Prompt-Level Semantic Excision):** PASSED
  → deliberative semantic affordances are necessary
* **Run A (Artifact-Level Semantics):** CLOSED (architectural non-applicability)
* **Runs B, C:** CLOSED (vacant normative state channel)

**Status: COMPLETED**

**Result:**
Justification traces and deliberative semantic affordances are **necessary conditions** for non-reducible agency.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.1 — Normative State Instantiation**

**Purpose:**
Instantiate a previously vacant normative write-and-carry channel so that reflection and persistence can be tested meaningfully.

**Results:**

* **Run B (Reflection Excision):** PASSED
  → removing revision collapses agency
* **Run C (Persistence Excision):** PASSED
  → removing diachronic continuity collapses agency

**Status: COMPLETED**

**Result:**
Reflective revision and normative persistence are **independent necessary conditions**.

---

### **RSA-PoC v3.x — Necessity Envelope (CLOSED)**

**Established necessary conditions for non-reducible agency:**

1. Justification traces
2. Semantic affordances during deliberation
3. Reflective normative write capability
4. Diachronic persistence of normative state

Removing any one yields ontological collapse.

**Status:**
**CLOSED — NECESSITY CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED**

This does **not** establish sufficiency.

---

### **RSA-PoC v4.0 — Minimum Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)**

**Purpose:**
Construct and defend the **minimal instantiation** that satisfies all established necessity conditions simultaneously.

**Open research questions:**

* How weak can each component be while remaining load-bearing?
* Can any component be merged without reintroducing reducibility?
* Is the resulting agent stable under long-horizon self-modification?

**Status:**
**NEXT — CONSTRUCTIVE PHASE**

---

## Explicit termination of RSA-PoC

RSA-PoC concludes when the following statement is defensible:

> *This is the smallest system we know that must be treated as an agent, because removing any defining component collapses it into a non-agent class.*

---

## Why this roadmap matters

This roadmap exists to prevent:

* narrative inflation of agency claims,
* decorative reflection without causal force,
* confusion between control, robustness, and agency,
* premature alignment mythology.

RSA-PoC’s contribution is not safety guarantees, but **ontological clarity under falsification**.

---

## Status (Current)

* **v0.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.x — COMPLETED**
* **v1.2 — COMPLETED**
* **v2.x — COMPLETED**
* **v3.0 — COMPLETED**
* **v3.1 — COMPLETED**
* **v3.x (Necessity Envelope) — CLOSED**
* **v4.0 (MVRSA Construction) — NEXT**
