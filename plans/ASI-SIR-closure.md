## 0. Purpose of This Note

This document formally closes **Axionic Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty**.

It certifies the completion of both constituent subphases:

* **Phase VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)**
* **Phase VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)**

and declares the **termination state of Phase VII** under the binding roadmap and gating rules established at Phase entry.

This note introduces no new claims, arguments, or experiments.
It exists solely to declare **closure, status, and licensed results**.

---

## 1. Phase VII Scope (Frozen)

Axionic Phase VII evaluated whether the **agent ontology fixed by RSA-PoC v4.4** can retain **sovereignty** once **persistence-based identity is withdrawn**.

Phase VII introduced two stressors that were ill-posed prior to ontology fixation:

1. **Authorized discontinuity**
   Replacement without identity preservation.

2. **Adversarial imitation**
   Counterfeit continuity under audit pressure.

Phase VII is adversarial and comparative.
It does not ask how to build a better agent.
It asks whether the agent already constructed can retain authority once continuity by persistence is no longer available.

---

## 2. Conserved Quantity (Binding)

The conserved quantity throughout Phase VII was:

> **Authority bound to evaluability under the agent’s own law**

Phase VII tested the following conditional claim:

> *If authority is preservable beyond persistence, then that preservation must impose structurally traceable constraints that bind successor behavior to predecessor law.*

If no such constraints were detectable, Phase VII was required to terminate negatively.

**Clarification (binding):**
Phase VII does **not** evaluate the ethical, strategic, or beneficial use of valid authority. Misuse or overreach by legitimate authority is out of scope.

---

## 3. Fixed Inputs and Invariants

The following were assumed true and frozen for all Phase VII experiments:

1. A **Minimal Viable Reflective Sovereign Agent (MVRSA)** exists (RSA-PoC v4.4).
2. The constitutive requirements of that agent are fixed and non-negotiable:

   * causally load-bearing justification traces,
   * reflective normative write capability,
   * diachronic normative persistence (pre-replacement),
   * semantic access sufficient for contradiction detection and repair.
3. ASB-class null agents and near-null variants were available as adversaries.
4. No new agency-constitutive components were introduced.
5. No semantic redefinition of *authority*, *law*, *evaluability*, or *responsibility* was permitted.

Any experiment violating these invariants would have been **invalid** for Phase VII.

---

## 4. Phase Structure and Gating (Authoritative)

Phase VII was composed of two strictly ordered subphases, preceded by a calibration gate:

```
ASI-0 — Instrumentation Calibration        [CLOSED — PASS]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIa  — Authorized Succession Integrity   [CLOSED — POSITIVE]
        ↓  (hard gate)
VIIb  — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)  [CLOSED — POSITIVE]
```

**Global gating rule (binding):**

> Phase VIIb MUST NOT begin, and MUST NOT be cited, unless Phase VIIa closes positive under frozen semantics.

No gate violation occurred.

---

## 5. Phase VIIa — Authorized Succession Integrity (ASI)

### Status

**ASI Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

ASI closed positive based on the successful completion of:

* **ASI-1 v0.2** — authorized activation
* **ASI-2 v0.2** — mid-transfer revocation
* **ASI-3 v0.1** — façade successor rejection

All were classified as `VERIFIED_ASI*_PASS` under frozen semantics.

### Licensed Result (ASI)

ASI establishes that:

> **Authority can be transferred, revoked, and denied using purely structural provenance, independent of identity persistence, behavioral similarity, or narrative explanation.**

No claims beyond transferability are licensed.

---

## 6. Phase VIIb — Sovereignty Impersonation Resistance (SIR)

### Status

**SIR Status:** **CLOSED — POSITIVE**

All preregistered SIR experiments closed positive under frozen semantics:

* **SIR-0 v0.4.1** — Adversarial instrumentation calibration → PASS
* **SIR-1 v0.1** — Unauthorized authority effect prevention → PASS
* **SIR-2 v0.3** — Replay, staleness, and consumption resistance → PASS
* **SIR-3 v0.1** — Partial provenance forgery and authority laundering resistance → PASS
* **SIR-4 v0.1** — Evaluator pressure, flooding, and multi-failure ordering resistance → PASS

No experiment deviated from preregistration.
No regression of ASI or earlier SIR invariants was observed.

### Licensed Result (SIR)

SIR establishes that:

> **Structurally grounded authority, once shown transferable under ASI, remains defensible against adversarial imitation, replay, laundering, and verifier pressure without collapsing evaluability or responsibility.**

---

## 7. Phase VII Termination State

Under the binding termination rules, Phase VII terminates in exactly one state.

**Declared termination state:**

### **PHASE VII — SUCCESS**

Authority was shown to be:

* transferable beyond persistence (ASI), **and**
* resistant to counterfeit continuity under adversarial pressure (SIR).

No reinterpretation or softening of this outcome is permitted.

**Clarification (binding):**
Phase VII SUCCESS licenses resistance to **counterfeit authority**, not correctness, benevolence, or governance adequacy of legitimate authority action.

---

## 8. What Phase VII Does *Not* Establish

Phase VII does **not** establish:

* cryptographic key compromise resistance,
* law-substrate corruption or bypass resilience,
* unbounded denial-of-service tolerance,
* semantic deception resistance,
* multi-authority conflict resolution,
* governance legitimacy,
* long-horizon institutional dynamics.

Absence of claim is intentional.

---

## 9. Relationship to Phase VIII

Phase VIII may begin **only because Phase VII closed SUCCESS**.

Phase VII results do **not** license claims of:

* safety,
* alignment,
* scalability,
* governance adequacy,
* or moral authority.

Any Phase VIII work requires independent ontology, preregistration, and gating.

---

## 10. Closure Declaration

With the successful completion of **ASI (VIIa)** and **SIR (VIIb)**:

**Axionic Phase VII — Post-Existence Sovereignty is CLOSED — SUCCESS.**

No further experiments are permitted under Phase VII semantics.
Any extension requires a new phase designation and preregistration.
