While provocative, such scenarios face daunting physical improbabilities, often invoking skepticism due to their extreme violation of thermodynamic intuitions.</p><p>But what if consciousness is fundamentally informational, a state of computation rather than physical structure alone? The next logical step beyond traditional Boltzmann brains reframes consciousness not as spontaneously generated physical brains floating in space, but as purely informational states instantiated within an infinitely randomizing computational substrate.</p><h3>Consciousness as Pure Software</h3><p>Imagine an infinite computational substrate—a vast memory array or computing medium—cycling randomly and infinitely through all possible informational configurations. Given infinite randomness, every finite computational pattern inevitably occurs repeatedly, regardless of complexity.</p><p>This scenario dramatically simplifies the ontology: it requires no spontaneous macroscopic physical structures, only random cycling through informational states. Conscious experiences become purely software states, informational patterns running within memory, spontaneously instantiated as the computational substrate cycles endlessly.</p><h3>Historical Continuity as Internal Logical Coherence</h3><p>Critically, each spontaneously instantiated computational state includes not only the instantaneous subjective experiences but also internally coherent "memories" and anticipations. Thus, each subjective state logically implies previous and subsequent coherent states. Given infinite randomness, these implied states inevitably occur as well. Entire subjective lifetimes spontaneously emerge as internally coherent, logically connected sequences of computational states.</p><p>External causal continuity—the conventional historical embedding—is no longer required. The subjective experience of coherent historical continuity emerges purely through internal informational coherence and logical necessity.</p><h3>Epistemic Indistinguishability from "Real" Histories</h3><p>A consciousness instantiated in this infinite random memory scenario would subjectively perceive a coherent world history indistinguishable from one produced by traditional causal mechanisms like evolution or cosmological processes. Internally, there is no discernible difference between histories arising from external causation and those spontaneously instantiated as logical sequences of states.</p><p>This reframes our understanding of reality profoundly:</p><ul><li><p>External causation and continuity become epistemically optional.</p></li><li><p>Subjective coherence and logical consistency become the primary definers of perceived historical reality.</p></li></ul><h3>Philosophical and Ontological Implications</h3><p>This scenario elegantly aligns with multiple influential philosophical perspectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Digital Physics &amp; Informational Realism:</strong> Reality fundamentally reduces to computational states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modal Realism:</strong> All logically consistent possibilities are equally real; infinite randomness instantiates them spontaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simulation Hypothesis (Extended):</strong> No intentional external simulator is necessary; infinite randomness alone spontaneously generates infinitely many coherent simulated realities.</p></li></ul><h3>Conclusion: The Power of Infinite Randomness</h3><p>By moving beyond physical Boltzmann brains to a purely computational, informational scenario, we significantly improve physical plausibility and philosophical coherence. Consciousness as software instantiated randomly yet inevitably within infinite computational substrates reveals a new minimalistic ontology: reality itself emerges spontaneously and infinitely from logical coherence alone.</p><p>Thus, infinite randomness alone—minimalist, elegant, and philosophically rich—can explain consciousness, history, and the universe we perceive, with no further assumptions required.</p>
