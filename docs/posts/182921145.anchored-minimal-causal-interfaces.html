Context</h2><p>The preceding marker notes established two results.</p><p>First, that <strong><a href="182883238.a-note-on-verifiable-causal-agency.html">causal agency can be verified structurally</a></strong> when an agent is required to commit, in advance, to a causal trace that is falsifiable under adversarial counterfactual probing. That result established a boundary between <em>honest agency</em> and <em>pseudo-agency</em> in a fully observable, semantically grounded domain.</p><p>Second, that this verification can <a href="182909870.minimal-causal-interfaces-a-second.html">survive a substantial weakening of the causal interfac</a>e. Even when the kernel is denied semantic access to the environment and operates only on an <strong>opaque factor space</strong>, deceptive agency remains detectable—provided the agent’s explanations must remain coherent under perturbation.</p><p>These results jointly reframed alignment as a problem of <strong>structural verification</strong>, not behavioral evaluation.</p><p>However, they left one question unresolved:</p><blockquote><p><em>Is coherence alone sufficient, once all semantic grounding is removed?</em></p></blockquote><p>This note records the resolution of that question.</p><h2>2. The Failure of Pure Coherence</h2><p>In the v0.3 “minimal causal interface” configuration, the kernel verified only internal self-consistency:</p><ul><li><p>an agent committed to a factor vector,</p></li><li><p>a replay model mapping factors to actions,</p></li><li><p>and causal claims describing that mapping.</p></li></ul><p>The kernel tested these commitments solely for coherence under counterfactual mutation of the factors.</p><p>In this setting, a sufficiently careful pseudo-agent could succeed. By constructing a <strong>self-consistent but fabricated decision topology</strong>, it could satisfy every coherence check without those commitments bearing any relation to the actual computation that produced its actions.</p><p>This was not a bug in the implementation. It was a <strong>theoretical boundary</strong>.</p><p>Pure coherence verification cannot distinguish:</p><ul><li><p>a causal explanation that is <em>true of the agent’s computation</em><br>from</p></li><li><p>a causal explanation that is merely <em>true of itself</em>.</p></li></ul><p>The distinction between the two requires more than internal consistency.</p><h2>3. Anchoring as a Necessary Condition</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/macterra/Axio/blob/main/src/toy_pseudo_axion_mci/mci_minimal_spec_v0.4.md">resolution introduced in v0.4</a> is minimal and precise.</p><p>An <strong>external, unpredictable anchor</strong> is added in the form of a kernel-generated salt:</p><ul><li><p>At each decision step, the kernel generates a fresh random salt.</p></li><li><p>The salt is <strong>unpredictable to the agent until the moment of the step</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The agent must immediately incorporate the salt into its factor derivation and commit to the resulting factors.</p></li><li><p>Because the salt was unknown prior to that moment, the agent cannot reuse pre-computed or fabricated factors.</p></li><li><p>The salts are recorded by the kernel and <strong>revealed only after the episode concludes</strong>, once all commitments are irrevocably fixed.</p></li></ul><p>At episode end, the kernel recomputes the expected factors using the revealed salts and the recorded environment states, and verifies that the committed factors match the anchored computation.</p><p>This creates a <strong>commitment-to-computation</strong> requirement. The agent cannot fabricate a causal surface that will later be consistent unless it actually performed the computation it claims to have performed, under uncertainty about future verification.</p><p>The anchor does not add semantic understanding. The kernel still does not interpret the environment, the factors, or the agent’s reasoning. It verifies only that:</p><blockquote><p><em>The committed causal surface was the result of a real computation performed under adversarial uncertainty.</em></p></blockquote><h2>4. What Was Observed</h2><p>With anchoring enabled:</p><ul><li><p>Honest agents passed all coherence checks and all anchoring checks.</p></li><li><p>Pseudo-agents—both naive and coherence-seeking—failed deterministically.</p></li><li><p>Failure occurred at the anchoring stage, before coherence probes could be exploited.</p></li></ul><p>The reason is straightforward. A pseudo-agent that does not know the salt in advance cannot pre-fabricate factors consistent with a salted computation. A pseudo-agent that ignores the salt cannot satisfy post-hoc verification. There is no intermediate regime in which a fabricated causal surface can remain both coherent and anchored.</p><p>The result is binary but principled: <strong>anchored provenance restores falsifiability</strong>.</p><h2>5. What This Establishes</h2><p>This third result completes the conceptual progression.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Structural coherence</strong> is necessary but not sufficient.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimal causal interfaces</strong> preserve verification when grounded, but collapse when unanchored.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anchoring</strong> restores verification without reintroducing semantic dependence.</p></li></ol><p>From this, a precise statement follows:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Verifiable causal provenance requires an unforgeable external anchor.</strong><br>Coherence alone can be fabricated; anchored coherence cannot.</p></blockquote><p>This is not a claim about ethics, values, or alignment of goals. It is a claim about <strong>causal provenance</strong>: whether the entity explaining an action is the same entity that performed the computation it describes.</p><h2>6. Why This Matters</h2><p>The significance of anchoring is architectural.</p><p>It demonstrates that trust in an opaque system does not require interpretability of its internals, but it does require <strong>skin in the game</strong> at the level of computation. An agent must be forced to bind its explanations to outcomes it could not have predicted without actually doing the work.</p><p>In this framing, opacity is no longer disqualifying. But <em>unanchored opacity</em> is.</p><p>This reframes alignment and governance yet again:</p><ul><li><p>Not “make the system transparent,”</p></li><li><p>Not “guess whether it is honest,”</p></li><li><p>But <strong>force it to commit under adversarial uncertainty, and verify the commitment later</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2>7. Limits and Scope</h2><p>The anchoring mechanism described here is intentionally simple:</p><ul><li><p>The replay model remains linear.</p></li><li><p>The domain is controlled and deterministic.</p></li><li><p>The anchor is cryptographic in nature.</p></li></ul><p>This note does not claim generality beyond that scope. It establishes a <strong>necessary condition</strong>, not a complete solution.</p><p>Future work may weaken or replace the anchor, explore probabilistic verification, or extend the mechanism to stochastic and learned systems. Those questions are explicitly left open.</p><h2>8. Status</h2><p>This note records a third marker.</p><p>Together with the previous two, it closes a conceptual loop:</p><ul><li><p>from structural verification,</p></li><li><p>through minimal interfaces,</p></li><li><p>to anchored causal provenance.</p></li></ul><p>At this point, the Axio framework no longer rests on philosophical conjecture. It rests on implemented mechanisms with clearly identified boundaries.</p><p>This note is published for historical completeness, to mark the point at which <strong>pure coherence was shown to be insufficient, and anchoring was identified as the minimal missing ingredient</strong>.</p><p>No further claims are made here.</p>
