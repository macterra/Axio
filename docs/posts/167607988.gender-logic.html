<p>The slogan "trans women are women" is frequently presented as a clear, moral truth, intended to affirm identity and inclusion. Yet examining its logical implications reveals deeper philosophical commitments than might initially appear.</p><p>To assert "trans women are women" is to establish that the category "woman" is defined entirely by subjective identification. If trans women—individuals whose biological sex differs from their gender identity—are indeed women, then biological sex, anatomy, genetics, reproductive capability, and traditional socialization must all be excluded from the definition. The sole remaining criterion is an internal, psychological state: feeling like or identifying as a woman.</p><p>This reveals a hidden assumption: that womanhood has no objective or external criteria. Such a position is radically subjective, as it makes the definition entirely dependent on an individual's internal sense of identity. While this stance supports certain inclusive social goals, it brings significant philosophical complications:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Circular Definitions:</strong><br>Defining "woman" by the criterion of "feeling like a woman" is circular. Without external referents, the concept of "feeling like a woman" becomes vacuous, as it depends on the term it aims to define.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loss of Objective Meaning:</strong><br>By reducing womanhood to an internal subjective state, the concept loses its communicability. Without intersubjective or objective criteria, people cannot reliably understand or verify one another’s use of the term.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conflict with Established Usage:</strong><br>Traditional linguistic, medical, historical, and cultural understandings of "woman" have emphasized biology, reproduction, and anatomy. A purely subjective definition breaks sharply from this tradition, potentially creating confusion, misunderstanding, and even policy incoherence.</p></li></ol><p>Proponents may accept these consequences willingly, prioritizing subjective identity affirmation above definitional clarity. Yet making these implications explicit is crucial. Only by transparently acknowledging the philosophical trade-offs involved can meaningful dialogue occur.</p>
