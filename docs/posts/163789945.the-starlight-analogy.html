At first glance, this concern seems reasonable—an endless proliferation of unseen worlds might appear unnecessarily complex. However, there's a compelling analogy from everyday physics that addresses this intuition directly.</p><p>Imagine standing outside on a clear night, gazing at a distant, faint star. Each second, only a handful of photons from that star enter your eye—perhaps fewer than a hundred. Yet, in that same second, the star emits an unimaginably large number of photons, perhaps on the order of 10⁴⁴ photons per second, radiating out equally in all directions.</p><p>If someone unfamiliar with physics heard this, they might protest: "Isn't it absurdly wasteful or overly complicated to suppose the star emits so many photons just so a tiny fraction can reach our eyes?"</p><p>Yet, physicists see no extravagance or complexity here. The star doesn't "aim" photons specifically toward observers. Rather, photons radiate evenly, indifferent to whether anyone is there to detect them. The overwhelming majority pass by unnoticed, streaming endlessly into the cosmos.</p><p>This is precisely how we should understand the multitude of worlds in the Many-Worlds Interpretation. Just like photons radiating from a star, quantum events produce branches continuously and naturally. Most branches remain forever beyond our direct experience, not because they are complicated or wasteful, but because our perspective is inherently local and limited.</p><p>Occam’s razor advises us to favor theories that are simplest in their assumptions and structure—not those that minimize sheer numbers of entities. The Many-Worlds Interpretation, despite its vast number of branches, is arguably simpler in its foundational assumptions compared to interpretations requiring additional, ad hoc mechanisms to "collapse" the wavefunction.</p><p>Thus, just as accepting the vast number of photons emitted by a star doesn't violate parsimony, neither does accepting the multitude of worlds implied by quantum mechanics. In fact, this perspective reveals a fundamental elegance beneath the apparent complexity—just as the simple physics of starlight resolves any apparent absurdity of cosmic "wastefulness."</p><p>The next time you hear objections about the "extravagance" of MWI, remember the humble photon. Nature, it seems, has never been concerned with how many entities it creates, only with the elegance and simplicity of the rules by which it operates.</p>
