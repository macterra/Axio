Its task was to identify, describe, and treat mental disorders based on empirical evidence, clinical observation, and consistent diagnostic criteria. Words were defined with precision, diagnoses had boundaries, and the same principles applied regardless of politics.</p><p>That is changing.</p><h3>The Signs of Capture</h3><p>Over the past decade, psychiatry has shown increasing susceptibility to political and ideological capture. This doesn’t mean every clinician has abandoned science — but it does mean institutional gatekeepers are now steering the profession toward alignment with particular social narratives, often at the expense of diagnostic integrity.</p><p>The symptoms of capture are clear:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Selective Redefinition of Terms</strong><br>Diagnostic language is being rewritten in ways that blur or abandon objective definitions. Categories once grounded in observable reality are replaced with socially malleable terms. The same clinical logic is not applied across contexts — some false beliefs are exempt from being called false, depending on their political sensitivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Policy Preceding Evidence</strong><br>Institutional guidelines now change in response to activist pressure or legal trends rather than new empirical findings. The timeline of these shifts often reveals no underlying scientific breakthrough — only the arrival of new political imperatives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asymmetric Application of Diagnostic Principles</strong><br>In ordinary cases, a belief that directly contradicts physical reality is considered a symptom to be evaluated. In politically protected domains, those same evaluative tools are suspended or reframed. This asymmetry signals an abandonment of value-neutral science.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chilling Effect on Inquiry</strong><br>Clinicians who publicly question the new orthodoxy risk reputational damage, professional sanction, or job loss. Even mild dissent is reframed as moral failure rather than scientific disagreement. This silences the debate necessary for self-correction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Institutional Gatekeeping</strong><br>Professional bodies now include activist representatives in the drafting of diagnostic standards, granting political actors direct influence over clinical definitions. These same bodies often advocate policy positions unrelated to core psychiatric competence.</p></li></ol><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>When psychiatry subordinates its standards to ideological loyalty, it trades the credibility of science for short-term political harmony. The loss is subtle but profound:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Diagnostic categories lose reliability.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Patients receive inconsistent care depending on the political status of their condition.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Public trust erodes</strong> as psychiatry becomes another branch of politics.</p></li></ul><p>The danger isn’t that psychiatry has a moral compass — the danger is that it is pointing in whatever direction the prevailing political winds blow, while claiming to remain purely scientific.</p><p>A profession captured by ideology can no longer reliably tell the truth when the truth is inconvenient. And if psychiatry won’t tell the truth about the mind, who will?</p>
