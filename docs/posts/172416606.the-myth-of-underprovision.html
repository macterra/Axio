The reasoning seems airtight:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Public goods</strong> are defined as non-rivalrous (my consumption doesn’t diminish yours) and non-excludable (you can’t stop non-payers).</p></li><li><p>If you can’t exclude non-payers, people free ride.</p></li><li><p>If people free ride, private actors won’t fund enough.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, coercive taxation is justified to “fix” the underprovision.</p></li></ul><p>That’s the standard narrative, drilled in as orthodoxy.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Where the Claim Really Comes From</h3><p>The claim isn’t an empirical discovery. It is the output of a model that assumes:</p><ol><li><p>No way to exclude non-payers exists or could evolve.</p></li><li><p>Voluntary cooperation is insufficient at scale.</p></li><li><p>A central planner knows the “optimal” level of provision.</p></li></ol><p>In other words, the inevitability of the state is baked in from the start.</p><div><hr></div><h3>History Doesn’t Agree</h3><p>The real record of human societies tells a different story:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lighthouses</strong> in Britain were privately built and funded by port fees until the state nationalized them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roads and bridges</strong> were historically toll-based, privately maintained turnpikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Education</strong> flourished through churches, guilds, and subscription schools long before government monopolies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Law and order</strong> in frontier zones and medieval Iceland emerged from voluntary associations and competing legal systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scientific discovery</strong> has been propelled by prizes, patrons, and voluntary societies.</p></li></ul><p>Far from being anomalies, these examples illustrate how people consistently solve so-called public goods problems without the state.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Sleight of Hand</h3><p>When economists say “underprovide,” they mean: <em>less than the quantity a planner’s social welfare function demands.</em> This is not objective analysis. It is a political judgment smuggled in under the banner of science. It presumes that “more” is always better, and that coercion has no real cost.</p><p>But coercion is never costless. Taxation requires threats. It warps incentives, crowds out alternatives, and entrenches monopolies. The tidy diagram in the economics textbook leaves out the destruction of agency.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What Markets Really Show</h3><p>Voluntary markets <a href="165708751.when-to-kill-a-project.html">reveal what people actually value enough to pay for</a>. If there’s less of X than a theorist wants, that isn’t “failure.” That’s the truth of preferences. And as technology evolves, the supposed “non-excludability” of public goods erodes—micropayments, contracts, and blockchains make exclusion trivial where it once wasn’t.</p><p>What looks like underprovision is usually provision in unfamiliar forms: messy, decentralized, diverse, voluntary. The complaint isn’t about scarcity, it’s about a refusal to conform to the state’s preferred template.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Anti-Statist Lesson</h3><p>The <a href="https://x.com/DeirdreMcClosk/status/1962190725711314976">marginalist revolution that McCloskey praises</a> already undermines totalist accounting. You can only ever owe <em>at the margin,</em> never for the whole past. Likewise, markets only ever provide <em>at the margin,</em> according to voluntary demand. Labeling that “insufficient” is not economics—it is ideology.</p><p><strong>The myth of underprovision is statism’s Trojan horse.</strong> Accept it, and you hand the state a blank check. Reject it, and the picture clarifies: there is no “failure” in voluntary cooperation—only the actual arrangements free people choose to build.</p><div><hr></div>
