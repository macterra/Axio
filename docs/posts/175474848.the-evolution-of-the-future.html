That thought, fleeting and fragile, was the birth of long-range consciousness: the dawn of temporal depth.</p><p>To conceive of a decade ahead is to stack several abstractions: number, duration, self, and counterfactual simulation. It requires a brain that can represent not just “later” but <em>a quantified interval</em>, a continuity of identity, and a hypothetical world that does not yet exist. That is not mere memory. That is recursive imagination—the power to step outside the present and watch the self advance through time.</p><p>No chimpanzee has ever done this. Their foresight spans hours, perhaps days; they cache food or tools but not intentions. <em>Homo erectus</em> planned hunts and migrations but left no evidence of calendrical imagination. Even Neanderthals, clever and deliberate, seem to have thought in cycles rather than timelines.</p><p>The first organism to project ten years ahead was almost certainly human. By the Upper Paleolithic, we were already simulating lifetimes: burying our dead, teaching our children crafts whose mastery exceeded a single season, painting herds that would return next year, next decade. The mind that could do this was not just <em>intelligent</em>; it was <em>temporalized</em>. It could narrate itself across years.</p><p>That was the evolutionary singularity of foresight. Once consciousness extended beyond immediate survival into imagined futures, causality inverted. The past no longer dictated behavior—the future did. From that point on, every decision was haunted by possible worlds.</p><p>Language crystallized this new dimension. Adverbs like <em>later</em> and <em>tomorrow</em> became linguistic prosthetics for long-term simulation. Rituals, calendars, and myths bound collective time. Humanity had begun to domesticate not just fire, but <em>duration</em>.</p><p>The emergence of the ten-year horizon marked a new kind of selection pressure. Natural selection had favored those who adapted to past conditions; cultural selection began favoring those who could anticipate future ones. The brain became a predictive engine, not a reactive one.</p><p>To think ten years ahead is to rebel against entropy. It is to imagine continuity where physics decrees decay. The first creature to do that changed the direction of causality itself—from matter shaping mind, to mind shaping matter across time.</p><p>That was the moment time became human.</p>
