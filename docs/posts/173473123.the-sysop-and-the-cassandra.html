The article portrays him as Silicon Valley’s doomsday preacher, insisting with near-certainty that AI development means human extinction. It also sketches his long arc — from self-taught wunderkind in the Extropians orbit, to prophet of “Friendly AI,” to today’s fatalist urging a global ban on superintelligence.</p><p>That framing is accurate as far as it goes, but it misses the texture of how these ideas first landed. I was there at the beginning.</p><div><hr></div><h2>The Sysop Talk</h2><p>At a Foresight Institute conference in California circa 2001, I was one of just five people in attendance at Yudkowsky’s very first public talk. His proposal was startling: build a global “Sysop” — an artificial superintelligence with absolute control, acting as a system operator for humanity. The Sysop would enforce safety, prevent rogue AIs, and manage civilization from above.</p><p>The mood in the room was both amused and critical. We pushed back hard, but in a spirit of fun. Even in embryo, the authoritarian implications were glaring: a benevolent dictator is still a dictator, even if it runs on silicon. We challenged him on whether such a scheme was desirable, let alone feasible. The exchange was lively, but respectful — exactly the kind of constructive skepticism the Extropian and Foresight cultures prized.</p><div><hr></div><h2>From Sysop to Doom</h2><p>Looking back, the irony is striking. In that first talk, Yudkowsky’s answer to the alignment problem was <em>more centralization</em>: a single AI to rule them all. Today, his answer is the opposite: <em>no AI at all</em>. Both extremes share the same root mistake — absolutism. He moves from “one machine must control everything” to “any machine will kill us all.”</p><p>From the Axio vantage, this is where his reasoning collapses. Agency cannot be foreclosed by fiat, whether through a Sysop or a universal ban. Agency branches, proliferates, adapts. Our task is not to abolish the branching but to cultivate futures with higher measure of survival, coherence, and flourishing.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Verdict</h2><p>The NYT is right: Yudkowsky is an influential prophet of AI doom. His warnings shaped Musk, Altman, and DeepMind, and seeded the entire AI safety discourse. But his absolutism — first in favor of a Sysop, now in favor of stopping everything — repeats the same error.</p><p>He deserves credit as a Cassandra who forced the world to take existential risk seriously. But from where I sit, having been there at the beginning, the future is not written in stone. Doom is not inevitable. The multiverse contains branches where agency endures. And those are the branches we must fight for.</p>
