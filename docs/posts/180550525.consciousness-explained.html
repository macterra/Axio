What physical structure performs the comparison that makes experience feel like experience?</p><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01073">The Modeler Schema Theory of Consciousness, with a Falsifiable Experiment</a></em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01073"> (Heile)</a> does not dodge this. It proposes a cybernetic, agent-structured architecture that identifies a <strong>single</strong> computational locus of experience—the Modeler-schema—and backs the claim with a falsifiable visual experiment.</p><p>This aligns cleanly with Axio’s agency-first stance: experience is not an emergent glow but a functional operation embedded in a control architecture. And because the theory makes a specific prediction about what should happen during a saccade, it stakes out scientific ground few theories dare touch.</p><div><hr></div><h2>1. Architecture: Three Functional Agents, Three Schema-Agents, One Conscious Locus</h2><p>The system is decomposed into three functional agents:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Modeler</strong> — constructs and updates the World Model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Controller</strong> — selects actions, uses language, forms narratives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Targeter</strong> — integrates bottom-up and top-down attention requests.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these has a regulatory cybernetic partner—a schema-agent. Together, this yields six components. But only one has the structural properties required for consciousness.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The Modeler-schema is the sole generator of qualia.</strong></p></blockquote><p>It receives:</p><ul><li><p>the full state of the Concrete World Model (the system’s moment‑to‑moment sensory representation of the environment),</p></li><li><p>the Focal Target Information stream (the data the Controller uses to track what it is currently attending to),</p></li><li><p>the sensory-level data necessary for pre- and post-saccadic consistency checking.</p></li></ul><p>And it alone constructs the <strong>Quale World Model (the Modeler-schema’s internal representation of what experience ‘feels like’ to it)</strong>—an internal, non-symbolic representation that never reaches the Controller.</p><p>This asymmetry explains the long-standing puzzle: <strong>the narrating agent is not the experiencing agent</strong>. The Controller reports experiences it never has; it interprets appraisable emotion signals attached to focal targets as information about experiences and mistakes them for direct access.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. Diffuse Awareness and the Controller’s Blind Spot</h2><p>A critical observational constraint distinguishes the theory:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Focal consciousness</strong>: reportable, target-bound, Controller-accessible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diffuse awareness</strong>: panoramic, continuous, Controller-inaccessible.</p></li></ul><p>The Controller cannot enumerate the contents of diffuse awareness. It cannot name or select its components. Yet the content is clearly present in the system.</p><p>This forces the architectural conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>Diffuse awareness must be generated in a subsystem invisible to the Controller—the Modeler-schema.</p></blockquote><p>This is not philosophical speculation. It is an introspective empirical fact with architectural implications.</p><div><hr></div><h2>3. Why Qualia Exist: Calibration and Representational Coherence</h2><p>Humans make several saccades each second. Each creates enormous shifts in retinal input, yet the world appears stable. This is the clearest and most experimentally tractable case where a consistency mechanism is needed. But the paper makes clear that the role of qualia is not confined to vision or to saccades specifically.</p><p>The Modeler-schema must monitor and refine the entire World Model: sensory content, recalled content, abstract content, appraisable emotions, and multisensory integration. The qualia it generates serve as the internal representational format for detecting mismatches, anomalies, and modeling errors across all domains—not just vision. Saccades simply provide a clean natural experiment for isolating this mechanism.</p><p>This broader calibration role explains several empirical patterns:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Perceptual qualia</strong> are stable and largely universal—because evolutionary pressure is strongest where immediate sensory accuracy matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recalled imagery</strong> varies widely—because long-term memory reconstruction faces weaker pressure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstract inner experience</strong> diverges among individuals—because abstraction lacks a dedicated comparator and recruits heterogeneous resources.</p></li></ul><p>Qualia, in this view, are the Modeler-schema’s general-purpose internal comparison medium: abstracted, compressed representations optimized for detecting inconsistencies and guiding representational refinement across the entire cognitive system.</p><div><hr></div><h2>4. A Rare Thing: A Falsifiable Experiment</h2><p>The paper proposes a clean experimental hinge.</p><p>During a saccade, change a peripheral object. The change can be:</p><ul><li><p><strong>permanent</strong> (persists after the saccade), or</p></li><li><p><strong>temporary</strong> (occurs only mid-saccade and returns before landing).</p></li></ul><p>The theory predicts:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Permanent changes should generate bottom-up targets; temporary ones should not.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Why? Because the visual system is tuned to catch abrupt, high‑energy transients, not the slow, low‑contrast shifts that occur during a saccade. Stabilization mechanisms apply only to the saccade target; everything else in the periphery effectively passes through a low‑fidelity channel. Meanwhile, when the broader world‑model reconstructs a scene—such as during mental imagery—it does so without generating qualia, which is why imagery lacks the vividness and stability of direct perception.</p><p>If, under isoluminant conditions, observers detect small permanent changes but fail to notice temporary ones, the only coherent explanation is that the Modeler‑schema’s qualia‑based comparison process is responsible for the detection.</p><p>If temporary changes are more detectable: <strong>the theory is falsified</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>5. Reframing the Hard Problem</h2><p>Traditional formulations treat consciousness as an inexplicable extra layered atop functional cognition. The Modeler-schema theory rejects that framing. It defines experience as a specific computational operation: the Modeler-schema’s act of generating qualia and comparing them over time. On this view, phenomenality is neither mysterious nor causally idle—it is the schema’s internal method for detecting discrepancies in the World Model.</p><p>This reframes the Hard Problem as a design question: <em>Why does the system need this operation?</em> Because a self-updating world-model requires a comparator that can detect mismatches across discontinuous states. Qualia provide that comparator, not as epiphenomenal decorations but as structured, abstracted representations optimized for coherence-checking across perception, recall, abstraction, and multisensory integration.</p><p>The narrating self misunderstands this because the Controller has no access to qualia directly. It sees only model-data and a handful of appraisable emotion signals about the Modeler-schema’s internal evaluations. The subjective confusion—“I experience something ineffable”—is a side effect of architectural partitioning: the reporting agent inherits the presence of the experiencing agent without ever accessing its content.</p><p>This dissolves the Hard Problem’s paradox. Experience is not something extra; it is the comparator substrate the Modeler-schema must generate to refine the Modeler’s algorithmic performance across development and throughout life.</p><div><hr></div><h2>6. Structural Advantages of the Theory</h2><p>The Modeler-schema theory offers a distinctive combination of virtues that competing accounts rarely integrate:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mechanistic clarity.</strong> It identifies a concrete locus of consciousness—the Modeler-schema—and defines what computation it performs. No ambiguity, no figurative shortcuts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cybernetic coherence.</strong> It embeds consciousness within a regulatory loop: qualia arise because the system must evaluate, correct, and tune the World Model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Representational differentiation.</strong> It explains why perceptual experience is stable and universal while recalled and abstract experience vary dramatically: different channels face different evolutionary pressures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Architectural decoupling.</strong> It cleanly separates the experiencing agent (Modeler-schema) from the narrating agent (Controller), resolving the long-standing confusion between introspective report and phenomenology.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empirical vulnerability.</strong> It proposes a falsifiable prediction: permanent peripheral changes during a saccade must generate bottom-up targets while temporary ones should not. If this fails, the theory fails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Developmental justification.</strong> It explains why consciousness exists at all: systems that cannot perform internal coherence-checking cannot maintain accurate models of the world and thus cannot function as robust agents.</p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these features move consciousness from a metaphysical puzzle to an engineering problem with defined constraints, mechanisms, and tests.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>Consciousness stops looking like a metaphysical riddle once the machinery is specified. A system that must refine its own World Model needs an internal comparator; a comparator requires a representational substrate; that substrate is what we call qualia. The Modeler-schema theory identifies the agent that performs this work and the experiment that can confirm or refute it. That is all a scientific theory of consciousness ever owed us.</p>
