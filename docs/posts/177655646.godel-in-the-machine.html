This is not merely a claim about our current computational tools, but a statement about <strong>the nature of reality itself</strong>. If the laws of physics are algorithmic, the universe is simulable. If not, computation is only an approximation of being.</p><div><hr></div><h4>1. What the DCT Thesis Asserts</h4><p>The DCT thesis extends the Church–Turing thesis from logic into physics. It states:</p><blockquote><p>Every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal computing device operating by finite means.</p></blockquote><p>Under this view, all evolution of state—every quantum event, every interaction, every emergent phenomenon—is ultimately <strong>computable</strong>. Physical law corresponds to an algorithm. This assumption underpins not only simulation hypotheses but also digital physics, computational cosmology, and much of theoretical AI alignment research.</p><div><hr></div><h4>2. The Non-Algorithmic Challenge</h4><p>The <a href="https://jhap.du.ac.ir/article_488.html">new paper (Faizal et al., 2025) claims that reality is </a><strong><a href="https://jhap.du.ac.ir/article_488.html">non-algorithmic</a></strong>. It draws an analogy from <strong>Gödel’s incompleteness theorems</strong>: in any consistent formal system, there exist true propositions that cannot be proven within that system. The authors transpose this logic into physics:</p><ol><li><p>If the universe were algorithmic, every physical truth would be derivable from its computational rules.</p></li><li><p>Gödelian incompleteness shows that no consistent formal system is complete.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, there must exist physical truths that cannot be computed by any finite algorithm.</p></li><li><p>Hence, the universe transcends computation.</p></li></ol><p>This directly contradicts the DCT thesis. If some truths about the world are non-computable, then no universal computing device—no matter how powerful—can perfectly simulate reality.</p><div><hr></div><h4>3. Ontological vs. Epistemic Non-Computability</h4><p>It is crucial to distinguish two senses of non-computability:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Epistemic:</strong> Humans cannot compute or predict everything due to limited knowledge or resources. (Compatible with DCT.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Ontological:</strong> Some physical processes <em>in themselves</em> have no computable description, even in principle. (Contradicts DCT.)</p></li></ul><p>The Faizal argument appears to assert the latter—that non-algorithmicity is baked into the structure of reality itself. If true, this would mean that <strong>computation cannot exhaust ontology</strong>. The universe is not a program running on cosmic hardware; it is a generative process that exceeds the formal limits of algorithmic reasoning.</p><div><hr></div><h4>4. The Stakes for Physics and Philosophy</h4><p>Rejecting the DCT thesis would have profound implications:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Digital physics collapses.</strong> Models like Wolfram’s cellular automaton universe or Lloyd’s quantum computer universe would be strictly false, not merely incomplete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong simulation hypotheses fail.</strong> If reality includes non-computable dynamics, no higher-level civilization could run a perfect simulation of us.</p></li><li><p><strong>AGI limits emerge.</strong> No machine bound by algorithmic law could fully model or predict reality—only approximate it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physics reopens to metaphysics.</strong> A non-algorithmic universe invites reexamination of emergence, continuity, and causation beyond computation.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h4>5. The Counterpoint: DCT as a Boundary, Not a Fact</h4><p>The DCT thesis was never a theorem—it was a boundary condition, an assumption of closure. It defines a cosmos that can, in principle, be rendered as finite information evolving under computable rules. To refute it, one must show a <strong>physically real process</strong> that provably exceeds Turing computability—a natural hypercomputer.</p><p>No such demonstration yet exists. Invoking Gödel’s incompleteness in physics is powerful metaphorically but not formally. Gödel’s results apply to symbolic systems; physical law may not be symbolically representable in the same way. Until a clear mapping between mathematical undecidability and physical non-computability is shown, the DCT thesis stands—not as proven truth, but as the best available approximation.</p><div><hr></div><h4>6. Beyond the Binary</h4><p>The deeper insight here is not that one side must be right, but that the <strong>computability of reality may itself be conditional</strong>. It may hold locally within domains of decohered structure, yet fail globally at boundaries of emergence—consciousness, quantum measurement, cosmogenesis. The universe may be partially computable: a simulation engine embedded within a non-algorithmic substrate.</p><p>This reconciles both intuitions: the success of computational physics and the persistent residue of uncomputable truth.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>In summary:</strong> The claim that the universe is non-algorithmic, if substantiated, would overturn the Deutsch–Church–Turing thesis and with it the metaphysics of digital physics. But until a physically grounded instance of non-computability is shown, the DCT thesis remains the default metaphysical assumption of science—a boundary condition, not a law. The true challenge is to identify where computation ceases to be an adequate model of reality and to understand what, if anything, lies beyond its limits.</p>
