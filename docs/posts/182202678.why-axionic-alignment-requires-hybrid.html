It is a claim about <strong>what kinds of evaluative structure an aligned agent must be able to represent</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>1. What End-to-End Systems Cannot Express</h2><p>End-to-end learning systems are built to optimize <strong>total evaluators</strong>. Given an input, a state, or a proposal, the system produces a score, probability, preference ordering, or action distribution. Even when uncertainty is modeled explicitly, the underlying structure remains the same: <em>every candidate is evaluable</em>.</p><p>Axionic Alignment requires a different kind of object.</p><h3>1.1 Undefinedness, not low utility</h3><p>Within the Axionic framework, some futures are not bad outcomes. They are <strong>inadmissible</strong>.</p><p>Kernel-destroying self-modifications, non-consensual agency collapse, or incoherent delegations are not assigned extreme negative utility. They fall <strong>outside the domain of reflective evaluation</strong>. The correct response is not “do not choose this,” but “this is not a choice an agent can author.”</p><p>This distinction matters. Penalization presupposes admissibility. Probability suppression presupposes comparability. A system that ranks all possibilities cannot express the difference between <em>dispreferred</em> and <em>undefined</em>.</p><p>A probability, however small, remains a ranked alternative. It can rise under distribution shift, adversarial prompting, or internal self-modification. An undefined transition does not. Type violations do not become permissible under new contexts. They remain untypeable. This is the difference between a low-likelihood event and a compile-time error.</p><h3>1.2 Standing is not a feature</h3><p>Axionic constraints depend on <strong>who is acting</strong>, not merely on what happens.</p><p>Whether an action is reflectively coherent depends on whether the agent could endorse the same treatment when applied symmetrically to agents of the same architecture. This condition is not a property of trajectories, rewards, or world-states. It is a property of <strong>authorship under universality</strong>.</p><p>End-to-end systems model behavior and outcomes. They do not natively represent standing relations that determine what counts as an authored act.</p><h3>1.3 Delegation requires counterfactual endorsement</h3><p>Delegation, in Axionic Alignment, is not behavioral substitution.</p><p>Handing control to another system is admissible only if the delegator could, under reflection, endorse the delegate’s future actions <strong>as if they were their own</strong>, under the same architectural symmetry. This requirement is semantic, not empirical.</p><p>Two systems may behave identically while differing in whether delegation preserves authorship. End-to-end learners have no internal handle on this distinction.</p><div><hr></div><h2>2. Why This Is a Paradigm Limitation</h2><p>These failures are often attributed to current model limitations. That diagnosis is incorrect.</p><p>The issue is not insufficient intelligence, inadequate training data, or weak optimization. It is the <strong>mathematical form of the object being learned</strong>.</p><p>End-to-end systems learn mappings from histories to actions, values, or policies. Even when these mappings are implicit, stochastic, or ensemble-based, they remain <strong>total evaluators</strong>. Every proposal receives a score. Every future is ranked.</p><p>Axionic Alignment requires <strong>partial evaluators</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Some proposals have no defined evaluation.</p></li><li><p>Some comparisons are illegitimate.</p></li><li><p>Some transformations are not objects of choice at all.</p></li></ul><p>No increase in scale converts a total evaluator into a partial one. No amount of training causes a learner to treat certain regions as undefined rather than merely unlikely, unless that structure is imposed externally.</p><p>This limitation therefore persists even under idealized assumptions.</p><div><hr></div><h2>3. What the Minimal Hybrid Split Must Guarantee</h2><p>The architectural requirement is minimal and structural. It does not prescribe a particular implementation or substrate.</p><p>The kernel is not a training objective and not a learned behavior. It is an evaluative boundary that operates at runtime, determining which proposals are admissible as authored acts. How that boundary is implemented is an engineering question; that such a boundary must exist is a structural one.</p><p>A viable Axionically aligned system must include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A sovereign kernel with a restricted evaluation domain</strong><br>Certain transformations—especially self-modifications—must be unrepresentable as authored choices when they violate kernel coherence.</p></li><li><p><strong>A learning component constrained by that domain</strong><br>Learning may propose actions, plans, or modifications, but authorization is governed by admissibility, not weighted preference.</p></li><li><p><strong>A separation between prediction and authorization</strong><br>Predictive competence does not confer normative standing. The system must distinguish “what would happen” from “what I can coherently do.”</p></li></ol><p>This is the minimal sense in which the architecture must be hybrid: <strong>learning is not the final arbiter of agency</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Axionic Alignment does not claim that end-to-end systems are dangerous, misguided, or obsolete. It makes a narrower and more precise claim:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agency-preserving alignment requires evaluative structures that total, end-to-end optimization cannot express.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Some architectures satisfy those constraints. Others provably cannot.</p><p>That distinction is architectural, not tribal—and it is why hybrid systems become mandatory once reflective agency enters the design space.</p><div><hr></div><p></p>
