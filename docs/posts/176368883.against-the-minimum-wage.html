Coercion Masquerading as Compassion</h3><p>A minimum wage law seems benevolent: it promises to lift the poor by decree. But beneath its moral varnish lies coercion. Every mandate of the state rests on a threat—comply or be punished. A minimum wage does not grant value to labor; it prohibits voluntary agreements below an arbitrary threshold. It criminalizes the consent of the willing.</p><p>In the language of <em><a href="175667290.axiocracy.html">Axiocracy</a></em>, this is <a href="164902314.what-counts-as-coercion.html">coercion</a>: the credible threat of harm to gain compliance. True compassion expands agency. The minimum wage contracts it. The law pretends to protect the powerless, but in practice, it forbids them from choosing work on terms they might otherwise accept.</p><div><hr></div><h3>2. Economic Reality: The Demand Curve for Labor</h3><p>The minimum wage is a price control. Raise the price of anything above its equilibrium and you reduce demand. This is not ideology; it is arithmetic. When the cost of hiring exceeds the marginal productivity of the worker, that worker is priced out of the market. The business either automates, outsources, or simply does not hire.</p><p>The visible effect is a higher wage for those who remain employed. The invisible effect—<a href="https://mises.org/articles-interest/which-seen-and-which-not-seen">which Bastiat would call the unseen</a>—is the job that never existed, the worker who never gained experience, the business that never formed. The minimum wage, like all economic coercion, redistributes scarcity.</p><div><hr></div><h3>3. The Hidden Victims: The Unemployed and the Unborn Jobs</h3><p>The moral tragedy of the minimum wage is not the layoff, but the <em>non-hiring</em>. The young, the unskilled, the immigrant, and the marginalized are locked out of entry-level employment by the very law that claims to help them. When labor is priced above its value, the least competitive are the first to vanish from the labor force.</p><p>The policy erases entire paths of possibility—timelines in which those workers gain skills, accumulate savings, and climb to self-sufficiency. The law selects against agency and experience—against evolution itself.</p><div><hr></div><h3>4. Automation and the Substitution Effect</h3><p>Minimum wage laws also accelerate automation. The higher the cost of human labor, the greater the incentive to replace it. Kiosks replace cashiers, apps replace clerks, and robots replace line workers. The substitution effect is not cruelty; it is adaptation. But the moral responsibility for forcing that adaptation falls on those who made human work artificially expensive.</p><p>The global economy compounds the effect. Capital can flee borders; labor cannot. When governments fix prices on labor, capital simply moves to jurisdictions that don’t—or to algorithms that never sleep.</p><div><hr></div><h3>5. Philosophical Integration: Value as Agency</h3><p>In the <em>Philosophy of Value</em>, coercion is not merely inefficient—it is anti-ethical. Value is measured in agency: the ability of conscious beings to act according to their preferences. The minimum wage reduces this measure. It eliminates voluntary exchanges, blocks the feedback loop of experience, and suppresses the natural discovery of value in the labor market.</p><p>The minimum wage is not a policy of justice. It is an aesthetic ritual—a way for moralists to feel virtuous while outsourcing the consequences to the unseen. It replaces voluntary coordination with forced uniformity, mistaking sympathy for wisdom.</p><div><hr></div><h3>6. Real Compassion: Voluntary Coordination</h3><p>A truly compassionate society does not forbid people from working for less than a bureaucrat’s decree. It cultivates skills, reduces barriers, and enables voluntary support. If we wish to help the poor, we should do so directly—through wage subsidies, apprenticeships, or unconditional charity—not by outlawing low-skill labor.</p><p>The moral high ground does not belong to those who legislate empathy. It belongs to those who understand that freedom, not force, is the root of flourishing.</p><blockquote><p>You cannot legislate value into existence. You can only ban those who would have created it.</p></blockquote>
