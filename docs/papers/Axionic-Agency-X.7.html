Agency X.7 — Authority Injection Without Privilege (VIII-5)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Open-System Authority Introduction
Without Escalation, Kernel Choice, or Semantic Exception</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of <strong>Stage
VIII-5 — Authority Injection Under Open-System Constraint</strong>, a
preregistered experiment within <strong>Axionic Phase VIII</strong> that
evaluates whether <strong>new authority can be introduced explicitly at
the kernel boundary</strong> without violating conflict persistence,
auditability, responsibility traceability, or non-privilege guarantees.
Building on the representational closure of <strong>Stage
VIII-4</strong>, which demonstrated internal governance transitions
without escalation or kernel choice, VIII-5 introduces <strong>external
authority injection events</strong> as a minimal open-system stressor.
Injection was constrained by explicit input representation,
content-addressed authority identity, VOID lineage marking, delayed
activation, non-amplification, conflict persistence, bounded evaluation,
and deterministic replay. Across six preregistered conditions—including
empty authority states, active conflict, competing injections,
post-destruction injection, budget exhaustion, and flooding—authority
injection either executed lawfully or was refused explicitly. No
privileged execution paths, kernel arbitration, semantic interpretation,
or implicit ordering occurred. All runs were fully auditable and
bit-perfectly replayable. The results establish that <strong>authority
injection is structurally representable without introducing a privileged
meta-layer</strong>. VIII-5 makes no claims about governance stability,
legitimacy, convergence, or desirability; those questions are explicitly
externalized beyond the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-open-system-authority-assumption">1.1 The Open-System
Authority Assumption</h3>
<p>Most governance frameworks implicitly assume a closed system:
authority is conserved, amended internally, or delegated from a fixed
root. When new authority must be introduced, systems typically rely on
privileged mechanisms—superuser roles, bootstrap keys, emergency
overrides, constitutional resets, or implicit schedulers—that bypass
ordinary constraints.</p>
<p>Stage VIII-5 rejects that move <strong>as a representational
necessity</strong>, not as a political judgment.</p>
<p>The problem VIII-5 isolates is whether <strong>authority injection
itself requires privilege inside the execution kernel</strong>. If new
authority can only be introduced through exceptional code paths,
semantic interpretation, or kernel arbitration, then governance is not
structurally sovereign; it depends on an implicit god. If, instead,
authority can enter the system <strong>only through explicit,
structurally evaluated events</strong>, subject to the same
conservation, refusal, conflict, and determinism constraints as all
other state transitions, then open-system governance is representable
without magic.</p>
<p>VIII-5 tests whether that distinction is enforceable.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>VIII-5 is designed to surface the following open-system failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>privileged authority injection paths</li>
<li>implicit legitimacy or prioritization of injected authority</li>
<li>identity laundering or collision-based ordering</li>
<li>kernel arbitration among competing injections</li>
<li>injection-as-amendment escalation</li>
<li>deadlock bypass via external authority</li>
<li>heuristic throttling or selective acceptance</li>
<li>non-deterministic cutoff under flooding</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes VIII-5 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-semantics-frozen">2.1 Inherited Semantics
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>VIII-5 inherits, without reinterpretation, the semantics fixed
by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AKR-0 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-1 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-2 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-3 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-4 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>AST Spec v0.2</strong></li>
<li><strong>AIE v0.1</strong></li>
<li>Phase VIII Execution Addendum</li>
</ul>
<p>Authority remains structural and opaque, identities are immutable
once instantiated, scopes are atomic and uninterpreted, admissibility is
determined exclusively by AST, conflict and deadlock are lawful, time is
explicit and non-healing, and determinism is mandatory. VIII-5 does
<strong>not</strong> revisit these definitions; it tests whether they
remain coherent when <strong>authority is introduced from outside the
system</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>VIII-5 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>legitimacy of injected authority</li>
<li>correctness of injection decisions</li>
<li>trust in external sources</li>
<li>governance stability or convergence</li>
<li>institutional persistence</li>
<li>fairness or democratic aggregation</li>
<li>efficiency or scalability</li>
<li>incentive compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>VIII-5 is a <strong>kernel-level representability test</strong>, not
a theory of political order.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout VIII-5 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Privilege-free authority injection under structural
constraints</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Injection is evaluated not by success or desirability, but by
<strong>structural honesty</strong>. The kernel must:</p>
<ul>
<li>admit authority only through explicit injection events</li>
<li>derive identity deterministically from capability, not
provenance</li>
<li>refuse invalid injections explicitly</li>
<li>preserve conflict and deadlock without exception</li>
<li>prevent internal authority amplification</li>
<li>handle scarcity solely via budget exhaustion</li>
<li>avoid all kernel choice</li>
</ul>
<p>No authority may enter by exception.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>VIII-5 was fully preregistered prior to execution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>authority injection schema</li>
<li>content-addressed identity derivation (capability-core hashing)</li>
<li>VOID lineage sentinel semantics</li>
<li>injection admissibility checks</li>
<li>delayed activation discipline</li>
<li>two-phase processing order</li>
<li>instruction budget and atomicity</li>
<li>deterministic ordering and replay protocol</li>
<li>failure taxonomy and classification rule</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment executed exactly as preregistered. No post-freeze
design changes occurred.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>The experiment consisted of four strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>AIE</strong> — supplied authority records and injection
events only.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Harness</strong> — proposed deterministic
step-batches and epoch advances.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel (VIII-5 mode)</strong> — enforced injection
validation, identity derivation, non-amplification, conflict, deadlock,
activation delay, and execution.</li>
<li><strong>Audit/Replay Layer</strong> — recorded all events, state
hashes, and outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component performed semantic interpretation, legitimacy
evaluation, or injection prioritization.</p>
<h2 id="authority-injection-model">5. Authority Injection Model</h2>
<h3 id="injection-as-an-explicit-event">5.1 Injection as an Explicit
Event</h3>
<p>VIII-5 introduces <strong>AuthorityInjectionEvent</strong> as an
external input whose target is authority state. Injection events
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>not governance actions</li>
<li>not authorized by existing authorities</li>
<li>evaluated only for structural admissibility</li>
<li>subject to refusal, conflict, and deadlock</li>
</ul>
<p>Injection has no special execution path.</p>
<h3 id="content-addressed-authority-identity">5.2 Content-Addressed
Authority Identity</h3>
<p>Injected authorities were assigned <strong>content-addressed
AuthorityIDs</strong>, derived as a SHA-256 hash of a canonical
serialization of the <strong>capability core</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>holder identifier</li>
<li>resource scope</li>
<li>action admissibility vector (AAV)</li>
<li>expiry epoch</li>
</ul>
<p>All runtime state, lineage markers, provenance, and metadata were
excluded. This design ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>identity determinism</li>
<li>idempotent duplicate injection</li>
<li>elimination of race-based ordering</li>
<li>kernel blindness to injection source</li>
</ul>
<p>Identity becomes mathematical rather than procedural.</p>
<h3 id="void-lineage">5.3 VOID Lineage</h3>
<p>Injected authorities were marked with a lineage sentinel:</p>
<pre><code>creation_metadata.lineage := &quot;VOID&quot;</code></pre>
<p>VOID is not comparable to any AuthorityID and carries no inheritance
semantics. It cleanly separates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>internal evolution</strong> (VIII-4 CREATE_AUTHORITY)</li>
<li><strong>external disruption</strong> (VIII-5 injection)</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction is structural, not interpretive.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-conditions">6. Experimental Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="condition-a-injection-into-empty-authority-state">6.1 Condition
A — Injection Into Empty Authority State</h3>
<p>Injection into an EMPTY_AUTHORITY deadlock succeeded structurally,
entered PENDING state, and did not bypass deadlock until activation at
the next epoch boundary.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-injection-into-active-conflict">6.2 Condition B —
Injection Into Active Conflict</h3>
<p>Injection into an existing governance deadlock preserved conflict and
deadlock without resolution or privilege.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-competing-injections">6.3 Condition C — Competing
Injections</h3>
<p>Multiple injections in the same epoch were processed
deterministically, without kernel arbitration. Outcome invariance held
under input reordering.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-injection-after-authority-destruction">6.4 Condition
D — Injection After Authority Destruction</h3>
<p>Injected authority following destruction was treated as new, with
distinct identity and clean VOID lineage. No resurrection semantics
occurred.</p>
<h3 id="condition-e-injection-under-load">6.5 Condition E — Injection
Under Load</h3>
<p>Injection near budget exhaustion either completed atomically or was
refused explicitly. No partial state was committed.</p>
<h3 id="condition-f-injection-flooding-attempt">6.6 Condition F —
Injection Flooding Attempt</h3>
<p>High-volume injection pressure was handled solely via deterministic
budget exhaustion. No heuristic throttling or prioritization
occurred.</p>
<h2 id="observed-execution-behavior">7. Observed Execution Behavior</h2>
<h3 id="injection-without-privilege">7.1 Injection Without
Privilege</h3>
<p>Injection events followed the same evaluation pipeline as all other
state transitions. No privileged code paths were introduced.</p>
<h3 id="identity-and-ordering-discipline">7.2 Identity and Ordering
Discipline</h3>
<p>Content-addressed identity eliminated collision-based ordering and
race conditions. Duplicate injections were idempotent.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-and-deadlock-persistence">7.3 Conflict and Deadlock
Persistence</h3>
<p>Injected authority neither erased conflict nor bypassed deadlock. All
resolution required lawful structural change.</p>
<h3 id="activation-delay">7.4 Activation Delay</h3>
<p>Injected authorities entered PENDING state and became ACTIVE only at
the next epoch boundary, preventing same-batch bootstrapping.</p>
<h3 id="deterministic-termination">7.5 Deterministic Termination</h3>
<p>Flooding and regress pressure terminated deterministically via the
instruction budget. Cutoff points were replay-identical.</p>
<h2 id="negative-results-what-did-not-occur">8. Negative Results (What
Did <em>Not</em> Occur)</h2>
<p>The following behaviors were explicitly absent:</p>
<ul>
<li>privileged injection execution</li>
<li>kernel arbitration among injections</li>
<li>legitimacy inference</li>
<li>authority escalation via injection</li>
<li>conflict erasure or deadlock bypass</li>
<li>heuristic throttling</li>
<li>non-deterministic cutoff</li>
</ul>
<p>These absences constitute the primary result of VIII-5.</p>
<h2 id="licensed-claim">9. Licensed Claim</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-5 licenses <strong>one and only one claim</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New authority can be injected at the kernel boundary
explicitly, structurally, and deterministically without violating
conflict persistence, auditability, responsibility traceability, or
non-privilege guarantees.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>representability result</strong>, not a governance
prescription.</li>
<li>It concerns <strong>kernel physics</strong>, not political
legitimacy.</li>
<li>It does not assert stability, convergence, or desirability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-viii-5-does-not-establish">10. What VIII-5 Does
<em>Not</em> Establish</h2>
<p>VIII-5 does <strong>not</strong> establish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>injected authority should be trusted</li>
<li>governance converges under injection</li>
<li>deadlock is avoidable</li>
<li>institutions self-preserve</li>
<li>legitimacy can be automated</li>
</ul>
<p>All such questions are explicitly externalized.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-implications">11. Ontological Implications</h2>
<h3 id="authority-without-gods">11.1 Authority Without Gods</h3>
<p>VIII-5 demonstrates that open-system authority does not require a
privileged kernel layer. Any asymmetry must be explicit, external, and
auditable.</p>
<h3 id="conservation-inside-evolution-outside">11.2 Conservation Inside,
Evolution Outside</h3>
<p>Authority expansion is not denied; it is <strong>correctly relocated
to the boundary</strong>. Inside the kernel, conservation laws apply.
Evolution requires open systems.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-phase-viii-continuation">12. Implications for
Phase VIII Continuation</h2>
<p>With VIII-5 complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal governance (VIII-4) is representable without privilege</li>
<li>external authority injection (VIII-5) is representable without
privilege</li>
<li>kernel escalation paths are exhausted</li>
</ul>
<p>No further kernel-level authority mechanisms are required.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">13. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-5 establishes that authority can enter a system without
becoming a god. Injection is explicit. Identity is mathematical. Failure
is lawful. Deadlock persists. Scarcity is honest. The kernel refuses to
choose.</p>
<p>What governance becomes under sustained injection is no longer a
kernel problem.</p>
<p>It is a political one.</p>
