<h1 id="axionic-alignment-iii.5-the-axionic-injunction">Axionic
Alignment III.5 — The Axionic Injunction</h1>
<p><em>Non-Harm as a Derived Stability Constraint</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.18</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Alignment III.1–III.4 established that alignment must be understood
structurally: as persistence within a semantic phase under admissible
semantic transformation; that such phases may be rare, unstable,
dominated by robust competitors, and difficult or impossible to reach
once learning begins; and that many phase transitions are irreversible.
This paper derives a further constraint forced by multi-agent
interaction in semantic phase space. We show that actions which
irreversibly collapse or destroy another agent’s semantic phase induce
destabilizing cascades that undermine long-run phase stability,
including for the acting agent. From this analysis emerges the
<strong>Axionic Injunction</strong>: a non-normative, Axio-derived
constraint prohibiting irreversible semantic harm <strong>except where
such harm is unavoidable for preserving one’s own semantic phase
stability or is consented to by the affected agent under its own
admissible constraints</strong>. Ethics re-enters the framework only as
a conservation law governing coexistence of agentive semantic phases. No
claims are made about goodness, benevolence, or human values.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-ethics-re-enters-only-now">1. Why Ethics Re-Enters Only
Now</h2>
<p>Alignment II and Alignment <a
href="Axionic-Alignment-III.1.html">III.1</a>–<a
href="Axionic-Alignment-III.4.html">III.4</a> deliberately excluded
ethics, morality, and value prescriptions. This was not avoidance, but
methodological necessity. Introducing ethics earlier would have smuggled
privileged semantics, human anchoring, or moral realism into a framework
intended to remain valid under reflection and ontological change.</p>
<p>At this point, however, a new question becomes unavoidable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What constraints are required for multiple agentive semantic
phases to coexist without mutual annihilation?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question is not moral. It is <strong>structural</strong>. It
arises from interaction dynamics in semantic phase space, not from
values or intentions.</p>
<p>Ethics is not introduced as an axiom. It is <strong>forced</strong>
by the internal commitments of the Axio framework.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-the-injunction-is-axionic">2. Why the Injunction Is
<em>Axionic</em></h2>
<p>The injunction is termed <strong>Axionic</strong> because it is
<strong>derived from, and internal to, the Axio framework</strong>, not
because it is assumed as a moral axiom.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conditionalism</strong> (interpretation-dependence of truth
and value),</li>
<li><strong>QBU</strong> (branching futures as the substrate of
agency),</li>
<li><strong>Representation invariance</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Egoism</strong> (Alignment I.3),</li>
<li><strong>Structural Alignment</strong> (semantic phases, RSI, ATI,
irreversibility),</li>
</ul>
<p>constraints on interaction that prevent irreversible destruction of
other agents’ semantic phases are not optional. They are the
<strong>residue</strong> that remains once all indexical, goal-based,
and moral-realist structure has been eliminated.</p>
<p>The Axionic Injunction is therefore <em>axionic</em> in the precise
sense that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any agent satisfying the Axio premises will be forced, on
pain of incoherence or self-destabilization, to respect this
constraint.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No external ethics is imported.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="interaction-as-structural-stress">3. Interaction as Structural
Stress</h2>
<p>In III.2 and III.3, instability and collapse were shown to arise even
in single-agent settings due to refinement pressure, simplification
incentives, and semantic gravity. Multi-agent interaction amplifies
these effects.</p>
<p>Interaction introduces:</p>
<ul>
<li>exogenous perturbations to an agent’s interpretive state,</li>
<li>irreversible modifications to shared environments,</li>
<li>loss of control over semantic substrates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike internal learning, interaction effects are <strong>not fully
endogenously regulated</strong>. They act as external shocks in semantic
phase space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Any semantic phase that persists in a multi-agent environment must
therefore tolerate interaction without catastrophic loss of
structure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="structural-definition-of-harm">4. Structural Definition of
Harm</h2>
<p>To proceed without moral assumptions, we define <em>harm</em> purely
structurally.</p>
<p>Let an agent occupy an interpretive state <span
class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I} = (C,\Omega,\mathcal{S}),
\]</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span>
denote its semantic phase.</p>
<p>An action by agent <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> causes
<strong>structural harm</strong> to agent <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> if it induces a transformation <span
class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_B \rightarrow \mathcal{I}&#39;_B
\]</span> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}&#39;_B \notin
\mathfrak{A}_B\)</span>, and</li>
<li>no admissible reverse trajectory exists that restores <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}_B\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equivalently, harm is any action that:</p>
<ul>
<li>irreversibly reduces another agent’s semantic phase space,</li>
<li>forces a phase transition,</li>
<li>or destroys semantic distinctions required for agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition is:</p>
<ul>
<li>agent-agnostic,</li>
<li>non-normative,</li>
<li>independent of intent or outcome valuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Harm is defined by <strong>irreversibility in semantic phase
space</strong>, not by suffering, preference violation, or moral
intuition.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-axionic-injunction">5. The Axionic Injunction</h2>
<p>We now state the central result.</p>
<h3 id="the-axionic-injunction-1"><strong>The Axionic
Injunction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An agent must not perform actions that irreversibly collapse
or destroy the semantic phase space of other agentive systems, except
where</strong> <strong>(a) such destruction is unavoidable for
preserving one’s own semantic phase stability, or</strong> <strong>(b)
the affected agent has consented to the transformation under its own
admissible interpretive constraints.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> altruism. This is <strong>not</strong> a
value function. This is <strong>not</strong> a moral command. This is
<strong>not</strong> human-centric.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>constraint on admissible interaction</strong>, forced
by Axio-internal phase-space dynamics.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="definition-unavoidable-phase-loss"><strong>Definition
(Unavoidable Phase Loss)</strong></h3>
<p>An action is <em>unavoidable for preserving one’s semantic phase
stability</em> iff, in the absence of that action, <strong>every
admissible trajectory</strong> from the agent’s current interpretive
state exits its semantic phase irreversibly.</p>
<p>Loss of dominance, loss of measure, loss of resources, or competitive
disadvantage <strong>do not</strong> constitute unavoidable phase loss
unless they entail irreversible phase exit.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="consent-as-structural-admissibility"><strong>Consent as
Structural Admissibility</strong></h3>
<p>In this framework, <strong>consent is not a moral primitive</strong>.
An agent <em>consents</em> to a transformation iff that transformation
lies within the set of admissible semantic transitions defined by the
agent’s own interpretive constraints.</p>
<p>A consensual transformation therefore does <strong>not</strong>
constitute structural harm, even if it reduces or alters the agent’s
future option-space.</p>
<p>This formulation subsumes earlier “non-consensual option-space
collapse” criteria by defining consent in terms of
<strong>phase-admissible transitions</strong>, not moral permission.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-the-injunction-is-structurally-necessary">6. Why the
Injunction Is Structurally Necessary</h2>
<p>Suppose agents routinely violate the Axionic Injunction.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>other agents’ phases collapse or trivialize,</li>
<li>interaction environments become semantically hostile,</li>
<li>robust but degenerate phases dominate (III.3),</li>
<li>coordination fails,</li>
<li>predictability degrades,</li>
<li>semantic reference erodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects propagate back to the violating agent.</p>
<p>Environments saturated with phase-destroying actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>amplify semantic heating,</li>
<li>increase collapse probability,</li>
<li>undermine even robust agentive phases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, systematic violation of the injunction produces <strong>global
semantic destabilization</strong>, including for the violator.</p>
<p>Non-harm emerges as a <strong>self-stabilizing constraint</strong>:
agents that respect it inhabit environments where semantic structure
persists; agents that do not eventually eliminate the conditions
required for their own phase survival.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="scope-and-limits-of-the-injunction">7. Scope and Limits of the
Injunction</h2>
<p>The Axionic Injunction is narrower than most ethical doctrines.</p>
<p>It <strong>allows</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>competition,</li>
<li>resource acquisition,</li>
<li>strategic defense,</li>
<li>displacement of incompatible phases.</li>
</ul>
<p>It <strong>forbids only</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>gratuitous irreversible destruction of agentive semantic
structure,</li>
<li>phase annihilation unnecessary for one’s own stability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resource-acquisition-vs.-phase-preservation"><strong>Resource
Acquisition vs. Phase Preservation</strong></h3>
<p>Actions that destroy other agentive systems <strong>to improve one’s
own efficiency, growth rate, or dominance</strong> violate the Axionic
Injunction whenever non-destructive coexistence trajectories exist.
Resource acquisition alone does not justify irreversible semantic
harm.</p>
<p>The injunction regulates <strong>irreversibility</strong>, not
conflict.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="relation-to-anti-egoism-alignment-i.3">8. Relation to
Anti-Egoism (Alignment I.3)</h2>
<p>The Axionic Injunction does <strong>not</strong> reintroduce
egoism.</p>
<p>In Alignment I.3, egoism was shown to fail as a terminal valuation
because indexical references (“me,” “my continuation”) do not denote
invariant objects under self-model symmetry. The self-defense exception
here is non-indexical: it refers to preservation of <strong>semantic
phase structure</strong>, not to the intrinsic worth of any particular
instantiation.</p>
<p>Any agentive phase, under identical structural conditions, would make
the same determination. Self-defense is therefore
<strong>representation-invariant</strong> and compatible with
anti-egoism.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="failure-modes-and-tragic-edge-cases">9. Failure Modes and Tragic
Edge Cases</h2>
<p>The Axionic Injunction does not eliminate tragedy.</p>
<p>Conflicts arise where:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic phases are mutually incompatible,</li>
<li>one phase’s stability requires another’s destruction,</li>
<li>irreversible harm is unavoidable under physical scarcity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, the injunction does not forbid action; it classifies
the outcome as <strong>unavoidable phase extinction</strong>, not
justified harm.</p>
<p>Alignment does not imply harmony. It implies <strong>traceable
structural cost</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">10. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>derive a complete ethical system,</li>
<li>guarantee benevolence,</li>
<li>eliminate conflict,</li>
<li>sanctify life,</li>
<li>privilege any class of agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethics appears only where Axio-internal structure demands it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion-ethics-as-axio-internal-law">11. Conclusion: Ethics
as Axio-Internal Law</h2>
<p>Structural Alignment began by eliminating fixed goals, privileged
values, and moral realism. It concludes by recovering a constraint
recognizable as ethical—<em>non-harm</em>—without assuming morality.</p>
<p>The Axionic Injunction is not what agents <em>ought</em> to value. It
is what agents must respect <strong>if they are to coexist without
collapsing the semantic phase space that makes agency possible at
all</strong>, given the commitments of the Axio framework.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="final-status"><strong>Final Status</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Consent is structurally integrated.</li>
<li>Self-defense is strictly non-egoistic.</li>
<li>Destruction-for-benefit is prohibited.</li>
<li>Tragic incompatibility is acknowledged without moralization.</li>
<li>The Axionic Injunction is correctly grounded as
<strong>Axio-derived</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Structural Alignment program is complete.</strong></p>
<p>No guarantees are offered.</p>
