Agency V.2 — Agency Conservation and the Sacrifice Pattern</h1>
<p><em>A Formal Analysis of Instrumental Harm in Modern Systems</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper formalizes a recurrent failure mode in governance systems:
the systematic destruction of individual agency as an instrumental means
of achieving system-level objectives. We term this failure mode the
<strong>Sacrifice Pattern</strong>. Using an agency-conservation
framework grounded in comparative reachable-futures distributions and
divergence-based harm metrics, we show that practices commonly framed as
“collateral damage” or “necessary tradeoffs” are structurally isomorphic
to ancient ritual sacrifice. The persistence of this pattern is
explained not by malice or intent, but by institutional selection under
standing asymmetry, responsibility diffusion, and cosmological
abstraction. We derive precise admissibility conditions under which harm
may be tolerated without becoming sacrificial, introduce robustness and
auditability constraints to prevent ethics washing, and show how modern
bureaucratic and algorithmic systems stabilize sacrificial regimes by
suppressing moral gradients. The framework is diagnostic rather than
prescriptive, providing concrete audit criteria for human and artificial
governance under uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Human societies repeatedly converge on practices that destroy some
lives, freedoms, or futures in order to preserve others. In ancient
contexts, these practices were explicit: ritual sacrifice, infanticide,
or exposure. In modern contexts, they are framed as <strong>collateral
damage</strong>, <strong>acceptable risk</strong>, or
<strong>unavoidable tradeoffs</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite surface differences, these practices share a common
structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>individual agents are treated as fungible instruments for stabilizing
or advancing system-level goals, without their consent, and under
conditions where lower–agency-loss alternatives are not excluded by
necessity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper provides a mechanical account of that structure. The aim
is not moral condemnation, but <strong>formal diagnosis</strong>: to
identify when agency conservation fails, why such failures recur, and
how they persist even in systems that explicitly reject sacrifice at the
level of stated values.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries-and-assumptions">2. Preliminaries and
Assumptions</h2>
<h3 id="agents-and-agency">2.1 Agents and Agency</h3>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> is any entity that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Possesses preferences or valuations,</li>
<li>Has the capacity for action selection,</li>
<li>Has standing against purely instrumental use.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> is defined operationally as the set of future
trajectories an agent can still steer toward from a given vantage
state.</p>
<p>No metaphysical claims about free will are required. Agency is
treated as a structural property of systems embedded in constraints.</p>
<h3 id="vantage-and-comparative-futures">2.2 Vantage and Comparative
Futures</h3>
<p>Fix a vantage state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> at time
<span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> for an agent <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_i\)</span> be the space of
relevant future trajectories over a horizon <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_i^\pi(\omega \mid s)\)</span> be the
distribution over reachable futures induced by policy <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All evaluations in this paper are <strong>comparative</strong>. No
appeal is made to policy-free, “natural,” or morally privileged
baselines.</p>
<h2 id="quantifying-agency-loss">3. Quantifying Agency Loss</h2>
<h3 id="hard-loss-and-soft-deformation">3.1 Hard Loss and Soft
Deformation</h3>
<p>Agency loss has two analytically distinct components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Hard loss</strong>: futures that become unreachable.</li>
<li><strong>Soft deformation</strong>: futures that remain reachable but
become statistically implausible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Define hard loss between two feasible policies:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
=
P_i^{\pi_1}\!\left(
\Omega_i \setminus \operatorname{supp}\!\left(P_i^{\pi_2}\right)
\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>Define soft deformation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
=
D_{\mathrm{KL}}\!\left(
P_i^{\pi_1}(\cdot \mid s)\,\|\,P_i^{\pi_2}(\cdot \mid s)
\right)
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="individual-agency-loss">3.2 Individual Agency Loss</h3>
<p>Define individual agency loss as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta A_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
=
\alpha\,H_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
+
\beta\,K_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This captures:</p>
<ul>
<li>death and incapacitation,</li>
<li>coercion and chilling effects,</li>
<li>deprivation and developmental truncation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="population-level-loss-and-standing">3.3 Population-Level Loss
and Standing</h3>
<p>For a population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> with standing
weights <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
=
\sum_{i \in P}
w_i\,\Delta A_i(\pi_1 \rightarrow \pi_2)
\]</span></p>
<p>Non-uniform <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> are permitted,
but must be <strong>explicit, justified, and owned</strong>, as standing
asymmetry is the enabling condition for sacrificial regimes.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-dynamics-and-standing-asymmetry">4. Institutional
Dynamics and Standing Asymmetry</h2>
<h3 id="institutional-objectives">4.1 Institutional Objectives</h3>
<p>Institutions operate under objectives of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
J(\pi)
=
-\,G(\pi)
+
\lambda\,C(\pi)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(G(\pi)\)</span> is goal attainment
(stability, compliance, victory, growth), <span
class="math inline">\(C(\pi)\)</span> is cost to decision-bearing actors
(political, legal, reputational), and <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a tradeoff parameter.</p>
<p>Agency loss enters only insofar as it affects <span
class="math inline">\(C(\pi)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="standing-sensitivity">4.2 Standing Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Define <strong>standing sensitivity</strong> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_i
=
\left|
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \Delta A_i}
\right|.
\]</span></p>
<p>Standing asymmetry exists when</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}[S_i \mid i \in V]
\ll
\mathbb{E}[S_j \mid j \in D],
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a victim-candidate
class and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> the decision-bearing
class.</p>
<h3 id="optimization-without-rationality">4.3 Optimization Without
Rationality</h3>
<p>No assumption is made that institutions explicitly optimize <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. Optimization here is
<strong>evolutionary and institutional</strong>, not cognitive.</p>
<p>Policies that improve <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> while
keeping <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> low tend to persist via
selection, imitation, and inertia, even under bounded rationality.</p>
<p>The Sacrifice Pattern is a <strong>selection attractor</strong>, not
a plan.</p>
<h2 id="the-sacrifice-pattern">5. The Sacrifice Pattern</h2>
<h3 id="definition">5.1 Definition</h3>
<p>A policy regime instantiates the <strong>Sacrifice Pattern</strong>
when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Instrumentality</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\exists i \in V :
\frac{\partial G}{\partial \Delta A_i} &gt; 0.
\]</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Non-consent</strong> Members of <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> lack effective exit or veto.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standing asymmetry</strong> Harm to <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> weakly affects institutional
cost.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Epistemic avoidability</strong> No documented,
agency-conserving exploration of lower–agency-loss alternatives
proportional to the stakes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Instrumentality, not intent, is the bright line.</p>
<h3 id="the-sacrifice-attractor">5.2 The Sacrifice Attractor</h3>
<p>Under standing asymmetry and responsibility diffusion, policies that
concentrate harm on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> while
improving <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> are locally stable
outcomes of institutional selection.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is an attractor.</p>
<h2 id="agency-conserving-exploration-antiethics-washing-constraint">6.
Agency-Conserving Exploration (Anti–Ethics-Washing Constraint)</h2>
<p>Epistemic avoidability requires that the <strong>process used to
explore alternatives</strong> be itself agency-conserving.</p>
<p>An exploration process <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is admissible only if it
satisfies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Standing preservation</li>
<li>Model diversity</li>
<li>Gradient visibility</li>
<li>Auditability</li>
</ol>
<p>Simulated exploration that suppresses victim gradients constitutes a
second-order sacrificial violation.</p>
<h2 id="coercive-capacity-a-functional-definition">7. Coercive Capacity:
A Functional Definition</h2>
<p>An agent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> possesses
<strong>coercive capacity</strong> relative to a goal <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> iff</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial G}{\partial A_i} \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>and <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> cannot be reduced
without diminishing enforced compliance, where <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> denotes the agent’s capacity to apply
violence, restrict exit, enforce compliance, or maintain coercive
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Coercive capacity is defined <strong>functionally</strong>, not by
role, identity, or narrative classification.</p>
<h2 id="gradient-suppression-pr-as-modern-theology">8. Gradient
Suppression: PR as Modern Theology</h2>
<p>Modern systems stabilize sacrificial regimes by suppressing moral
gradients through aggregation, abstraction, responsibility diffusion,
and cosmology tokens.</p>
<p>Formally,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \Delta A_i} \downarrow
\quad \text{while} \quad
\Delta A_i \not\downarrow
\]</span></p>
<p>This is functionally identical to theological sanctification in
ancient sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="admissibility-under-agency-conservation">9. Admissibility Under
Agency Conservation</h2>
<p>A policy <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is admissible only
if all conditions hold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Targeting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minimality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Non-instrumentality</strong>, requiring</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial G}{\partial \Delta A_i}
\approx
0
\quad
\text{for non-coercive agents};
\]</span></p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Responsibility localization</strong></li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong>, such that admissibility is invariant
across a reasonable range of <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha/\beta\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Policies that rely on suppressing soft deformation terms fail.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-algorithmic-governance">10. Implications for
Algorithmic Governance</h2>
<p>Any governance system—human or artificial—that aggregates utility
while hiding per-agent marginal agency loss is structurally
sacrificial.</p>
<p>Safe governance systems must expose</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall i :
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \Delta A_i}
\]</span></p>
<p>as a first-class metric.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Agency conservation provides a unifying diagnostic for ethical
failure across historical, bureaucratic, and algorithmic systems. Ritual
sacrifice and modern collateral damage differ in presentation, not
structure. Both arise when systems stabilize goals under standing
asymmetry and responsibility diffusion.</p>
<p>Preventing sacrifice requires institutional design: restoring
standing, enforcing exit and veto, localizing responsibility, auditing
exploration, and rejecting abstractions that override individual
agency.</p>
<p>Where those constraints are absent, sacrifice will recur—whatever
name it is given.</p>
