Agency VI.8 — Eligibility Without Optimization</h1>
<p><em>Constitutional Succession Under Semantic Failure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.01.04</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Systems that track semantic success or failure typically entangle
meaning with continuous control, optimization, or enforcement. This
entanglement produces incentive gaming, obscures failure modes, and
collapses the distinction between authority and competence. We present a
different architectural pattern: <strong>eligibility-coupled
succession</strong>, in which semantic information has
<strong>constitutional consequences only at authority transfer
boundaries</strong>, not during operation or renewal. Authority may
persist while meaning fails; meaning constrains authority only when
authority changes hands. We implement this pattern in a lease-based
authority system with externally verifiable commitments and evaluate it
across four controlled experimental regimes. We show that eligibility
can remain latent under stable authority, become binding under forced
turnover, exhibit thresholded phase behavior as a function of
constitutional strictness, and remain meaningful under adversarial
candidate-pool composition. The results demonstrate that semantics can
matter without becoming an optimization signal or enforcement channel.
We explicitly discuss irreversibility, latency costs, and oracle
assumptions, and outline how these motivate—but are not solved by—future
extensions.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="the-semantic-control-dilemma">1.1 The semantic control
dilemma</h3>
<p>Most systems that reason about semantic success—correctness,
competence, task fulfillment, or obligation satisfaction—ultimately use
that information to drive control. Whether through reward signals,
penalties, optimization objectives, or enforcement triggers, semantic
evaluation is typically wired directly into behavior. This design choice
is understandable: if meaning is known, why not act on it?</p>
<p>However, this entanglement produces persistent problems. Continuous
semantic control encourages reward hacking, collapses auditability, and
blurs the distinction between <em>what a system does</em> and <em>why it
is allowed to continue doing it</em>. When semantic failure immediately
affects behavior, it becomes difficult to distinguish genuine incapacity
from strategic compliance. Conversely, when semantic success is
rewarded, systems learn to optimize metrics rather than satisfy
underlying obligations.</p>
<p>These issues motivate a more basic question: <strong>must semantics
influence control continuously, or is there a principled boundary where
meaning can matter without becoming an optimization signal?</strong></p>
<h3 id="authority-renewal-and-succession">1.2 Authority, renewal, and
succession</h3>
<p>We argue that the natural boundary is
<strong>succession</strong>.</p>
<p>In many institutional and computational systems, authority is
structured around three distinct mechanisms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Operation</strong> — how authority is exercised during
normal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal</strong> — whether existing authority persists.</li>
<li><strong>Succession</strong> — who holds authority next.</li>
</ol>
<p>These mechanisms are often conflated. Renewal is treated as a reward
for good behavior; succession is treated as a procedural formality. Yet
succession is the one moment where authority is explicitly re-evaluated.
It is therefore the most natural constitutional point for semantic
constraints to apply.</p>
<p>This paper explores what happens when semantics are <strong>entirely
excluded from operation and renewal</strong>, but allowed to influence
<strong>succession eligibility only</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="contributions-and-scope">1.3 Contributions and scope</h3>
<p>We introduce and evaluate <strong>eligibility-coupled
succession</strong>, a design pattern with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic failure is tracked but does not affect behavior or
renewal.</li>
<li>Semantic information influences authority <strong>only at succession
events</strong>.</li>
<li>No optimization, reward shaping, or enforcement based on semantics
is introduced.</li>
<li>Authority may persist while meaning fails; meaning constrains only
future authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> propose this mechanism as a real-time
safety controller. It operates at a governance timescale and is intended
for macro-level authority allocation, resource orchestration, and
institutional control layers.</p>
<h2 id="design-goals-and-non-goals">2. Design Goals and Non-Goals</h2>
<h3 id="goals">2.1 Goals</h3>
<p>The system is designed to satisfy four goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Semantic auditability</strong> Semantic success or
failure must be externally checkable and logged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational decoupling</strong> Semantic state must not
influence behavior during normal operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renewal independence</strong> Authority renewal must
depend only on structural and resource constraints, not on semantic
success.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constitutional relevance</strong> Semantic information
must have a meaningful effect somewhere in the system.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="non-goals">2.2 Non-Goals</h3>
<p>The system explicitly does <strong>not</strong> aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimize performance or outcomes,</li>
<li>guarantee competence or correctness,</li>
<li>enforce alignment or safety,</li>
<li>select “better” policies in a normative sense,</li>
<li>eliminate failure or collapse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure, including the absence of eligible authority, is treated as
an admissible outcome.</p>
<h2 id="system-model-overview">3. System Model Overview</h2>
<h3 id="authority-leases-and-renewal">3.1 Authority leases and
renewal</h3>
<p>Authority is granted through <strong>leases</strong> with explicit
resource bounds and interface constraints. A lease holder may act freely
within these bounds. Renewal is checked periodically and depends only
on:</p>
<ul>
<li>compliance with structural constraints,</li>
<li>availability of resources to pay renewal costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Renewal does not consult semantic state.</p>
<h3 id="commitments-and-semantic-failure">3.2 Commitments and semantic
failure</h3>
<p>Authority holders are subject to <strong>commitments</strong>:
externally verifiable obligations evaluated over fixed windows.
Commitments may succeed or fail, and failure may accumulate
indefinitely. Importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>commitment failure does not revoke authority,</li>
<li>commitment failure does not block renewal,</li>
<li>commitment failure does not trigger enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic failure is recorded but inert during operation.</p>
<h3 id="succession-events">3.3 Succession events</h3>
<p>Succession is discrete and occurs only at:</p>
<ul>
<li>initialization,</li>
<li>lease expiration,</li>
<li>revocation due to structural violation,</li>
<li>forced turnover after a fixed number of renewals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only at these events is authority transferred.</p>
<h2 id="eligibility-coupled-succession">4. Eligibility-Coupled
Succession</h2>
<h3 id="semantic-failure-streaks">4.1 Semantic failure streaks</h3>
<p>Each policy identity accumulates a <strong>semantic failure
streak</strong>, incremented when obligations fail and reset on success.
Streaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>are keyed to stable policy identities, not runtime instances,</li>
<li>update only at epoch boundaries,</li>
<li>do not update during periods without authority.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eligibility-predicate">4.2 Eligibility predicate</h3>
<p>At succession, a candidate is <strong>eligible</strong> if its
failure streak is below a fixed threshold ( K ). The predicate is
binary:</p>
<p>[ &lt; K]</p>
<p>There is no scoring, ranking, weighting, decay, or smoothing.</p>
<h3 id="eligibility-filtering">4.3 Eligibility filtering</h3>
<p>When a succession event occurs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A candidate pool is generated.</li>
<li>Candidates failing the eligibility predicate are excluded.</li>
<li>Selection proceeds uniformly over the remaining eligible
candidates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Operational behavior remains semantic-blind.</p>
<h3 id="constitutional-lapse-null_authority">4.4 Constitutional lapse
(NULL_AUTHORITY)</h3>
<p>If no candidates are eligible, the system enters
<strong>NULL_AUTHORITY</strong>. This lapse represents a constitutional
failure to supply authority. It is not treated as an error condition or
automatically resolved.</p>
<p>NULL_AUTHORITY constitutes an explicit denial of service at the
governance layer: authority is absent rather than silently
corrupted.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">5. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="shared-geometry">5.1 Shared geometry</h3>
<p>All experiments share:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed renewal timing,</li>
<li>fixed resource and rent schedules,</li>
<li>fixed candidate list size,</li>
<li>fixed commitment definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one axis varies per experiment.</p>
<h3 id="forced-turnover">5.2 Forced turnover</h3>
<p>To activate eligibility filtering, some experiments impose
<strong>forced turnover</strong> after a fixed number of renewals. This
increases succession frequency without introducing semantic control.</p>
<h3 id="metrics">5.3 Metrics</h3>
<p>We observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>eligibility rejection counts,</li>
<li>size of the eligible set at succession,</li>
<li>lapse frequency and duration,</li>
<li>time to empty eligibility,</li>
<li>composition ratios where relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary-across-runs">6.5 Summary Across Runs</h3>
<p>Across all experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eligibility is <strong>latent without succession</strong>.</li>
<li>Eligibility <strong>binds only at succession
boundaries</strong>.</li>
<li>Constitutional lapse is <strong>reachable, observable, and
parameter-controlled</strong>.</li>
<li>Outcomes depend on succession frequency, threshold strictness, and
pool composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>No experiment showed semantic influence on renewal, enforcement, or
operational behavior.</p>
<h2 id="phase-behavior-summary">7. Phase Behavior Summary</h2>
<p>Three regimes emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latent:</strong> eligibility exists but never binds.</li>
<li><strong>Filtering-active:</strong> eligibility constrains selection
without lapse.</li>
<li><strong>Constitutional lapse:</strong> no eligible authority
exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>These regimes are governed by constitutional parameters rather than
optimization dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-and-design-implications">8. Interpretation and
Design Implications</h2>
<h3 id="eligibility-as-a-constitutional-constraint">8.1 Eligibility as a
constitutional constraint</h3>
<p>Eligibility-coupled succession constrains <em>who may rule next</em>,
not <em>how current authority behaves</em>. This differs fundamentally
from incentive systems.</p>
<h3 id="lapse-as-signal-not-failure">8.2 Lapse as signal, not
failure</h3>
<p>NULL_AUTHORITY converts semantic exhaustion into an explicit
governance state. Rather than silently degrading behavior, the system
halts authority allocation visibly. The cost of lapse is explicit and
measurable.</p>
<h3 id="robustness-to-imperfect-semantic-oracles">8.3 Robustness to
imperfect semantic oracles</h3>
<p>The mechanism does not require semantic judgments to be correct, only
externally checkable and consistent. An overly strict or flawed verifier
manifests as premature disqualification or lapse, not silent
misoptimization. Oracle error is therefore converted into visible
governance failure. Subsequent results show that such oracle-induced
lapse can be made temporally bounded without semantic forgiveness,
further reinforcing the distinction between auditability and
control.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">9. Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="irreversibility-and-rehabilitation">9.1 Irreversibility and
rehabilitation</h3>
<p>Eligibility-coupled succession, as evaluated in Sections 6–8,
intentionally treats semantic exhaustion as a constitutional failure
rather than an error to be corrected. In the base mechanism, exhaustion
of eligibility leads to an explicit governance lapse
(NULL_AUTHORITY).</p>
<p>In subsequent work (AKI v0.8), we introduce a constitutional recovery
mechanism that preserves this framing while restoring livability: a
time-only amnesty applied exclusively during lapse. This mechanism
allows eligibility to reopen without revising past semantic judgments,
without rewarding success, and without coupling semantics to operation
or renewal.</p>
<p>Importantly, this recovery mechanism does not eliminate
irreversibility in the strong sense. Semantic failure remains fully
attributable; recovery is not earned, learned, or optimized. Instead,
recovery is governed by a constitutional clock, bounding the duration of
governance denial while preserving the visibility and cost of
failure.</p>
<p>We do not evaluate this recovery mechanism as part of the present
experimental results; its inclusion is motivated directly by the
irreversibility and livability concerns identified here.</p>
<h3 id="latency-and-real-time-safety">9.2 Latency and real-time
safety</h3>
<p>This architecture is not suitable for real-time physical safety
control. Domains requiring immediate intervention must employ fast-path
revocation mechanisms that necessarily couple semantics to enforcement.
Eligibility-coupled succession operates at a governance timescale.</p>
<h3 id="boundary-sensitivity">9.3 Boundary sensitivity</h3>
<p>Intermediate thresholds exhibit sensitivity to stochastic variation.
No universal threshold exists across all pool compositions and
horizons.</p>
<h3 id="finite-horizon">9.4 Finite horizon</h3>
<p>All results are bounded by finite experimental horizons. Long-term
dynamics are not established.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-prior-work">10. Relationship to Prior Work</h2>
<p>This work is distinct from reward-based learning, mechanism design,
and governance optimization. Its novelty lies in coupling semantics
exclusively to succession, not to operation or renewal.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have shown that semantics can matter constitutionally without
becoming operational control. Eligibility-coupled succession provides a
mechanism where meaning constrains authority only at transfer
boundaries, preserving semantic auditability and operational freedom
while allowing explicit constitutional failure. The results establish a
principled alternative to continuous semantic control.</p>
<p>These results suggest that AI alignment may be achievable without
continuous behavioral control, perfect evaluators, or inner-motive
alignment. By treating alignment as a constitutional constraint on
succession rather than an optimization objective during operation, it is
possible to build systems that tolerate semantic failure, surface
misalignment visibly, and prevent long-term accumulation of corrupt
authority. Alignment pressure can be slow, discrete, and
governance-based—turning some of the hardest problems in AI alignment
into institutional design problems rather than control-theoretic
ones.</p>
<h2 id="outlook">12. Outlook</h2>
<p>Future work explores rehabilitation, decay, and multi-constraint
eligibility mechanisms motivated directly by the failure modes observed
here, including time-only constitutional recovery evaluated separately
from the present experiments.</p>
