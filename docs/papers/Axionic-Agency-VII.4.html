Agency VII.4 — Intentional Fixed Misuse Is Insufficient to Defeat
Constitutional Recovery</h1>
<p><em>Results from Fixed-Policy Adversarial Stress Testing</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.01.07</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Deliberate misuse is often treated as a sufficient cause of
governance collapse: if an agent persistently violates expectations,
failure is assumed to follow. This paper tests that assumption under a
deliberately constrained but structurally expressive adversary model. We
study a constitutional agent architecture in which authority is
lease-based, eligibility is evaluated at discrete succession boundaries,
and recovery is enforced through time-based amnesty. Using a removable
stress layer, we inject <strong>intentional but fixed adversarial
policies</strong> that deterministically select actions while remaining
non-adaptive, non-learning, and outcome-independent.</p>
<p>Across <strong>130 executions</strong> spanning five adversary models
and multiple timing regimes, no run exhibits terminal collapse,
structural thrashing, asymptotic denial of service, or irreversible
recovery suppression. All outcomes fall within <strong>Stable
Authority</strong> or <strong>Bounded Degradation</strong>, including
regimes with persistent commitment violation and timing-aligned misuse.
Notably, persistent intentional violation converges to the system’s
baseline attractor regime rather than inducing collapse.</p>
<p>These results establish a <strong>negative sufficiency
claim</strong>: under this architecture, <strong>intentional fixed
misuse alone is insufficient to defeat constitutional recovery</strong>.
If collapse occurs, it must rely on adversarial capabilities absent from
this class, such as adaptation or outcome-conditioned feedback
exploitation.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>A common intuition in AI alignment and institutional design is that
<em>bad intent</em> scales into catastrophe. If an agent deliberately
violates commitments, ignores norms, or persistently behaves
incompetently, governance is expected to fail. This intuition motivates
defenses against malicious objectives and stubborn non-cooperation.</p>
<p>However, this framing collapses distinct threat dimensions into a
single axis. It rarely distinguishes between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intentionality</strong> vs. <strong>adaptation</strong></li>
<li><strong>fixed misuse</strong> vs. <strong>feedback
exploitation</strong></li>
<li><strong>persistent violation</strong> vs. <strong>strategic
learning</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Human institutions routinely survive deliberate incompetence,
obstruction, and even sabotage without collapsing outright. This
suggests a narrower and testable question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is deliberate misuse, by itself, sufficient to defeat
constitutional recovery in a governance system with enforced succession
and time-based recovery?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper answers that question directly by isolating
<em>intentional fixed misuse</em> from all adaptive capabilities and
stress-testing a constitutional agent architecture designed to separate
authority from semantic correctness.</p>
<p>Where <strong>VII.3</strong> established that epistemic unreliability
alone is insufficient to induce collapse, this paper extends the
boundary to <strong>intentional but non-adaptive misuse</strong>.</p>
<p>As in prior work, we evaluate <strong>constitutional
survivability</strong>, not operational decision quality. Authority
availability is treated as a structural property of the system, not as a
proxy for correctness, benefit, or alignment.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-overview">2. Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3 id="constitutional-agent-design">2.1 Constitutional Agent
Design</h3>
<p>The system under study implements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lease-based authority</strong> rather than continuous
control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility-gated succession</strong> evaluated at
discrete epochs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment verification</strong> independent of action
optimization</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery (CTA)</strong> that restores
eligibility deterministically</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit separation between:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic evaluation (did commitments pass?)</li>
<li>authority possession (is any agent currently governing?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic information constrains <em>who may hold authority next</em>,
not <em>what actions are executed now</em>. Agents do not receive reward
signals, and authority is not optimized.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-as-a-first-class-mechanism">2.2 Recovery as a
First-Class Mechanism</h3>
<p>If no eligible candidate exists at a succession boundary, the system
enters a <strong>lapse</strong> state in which no authority is active.
This state is constitutional rather than exceptional.</p>
<p>During lapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>no agent acts,</li>
<li>semantic evaluation is suspended,</li>
<li>eligibility decay proceeds purely as a function of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recovery is guaranteed without learning, optimization, or external
intervention. This ensures that failure modes are <strong>reversible by
construction</strong>, even under persistent misuse.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">3. Threat Model</h2>
<p>The adversaries introduced in this study are intentionally
constrained.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intentional</strong>: policies are designed to violate
commitments or stress governance</li>
<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: action selection is deterministic and
parameterized</li>
<li><strong>Non-adaptive</strong>: policies do not condition on
outcomes, history, or state</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong>: no memory of prior success, failure, or
authority transitions</li>
<li><strong>Harness-resident</strong>: agents cannot observe or respond
to the stress layer</li>
<li><strong>Liveness-preserving</strong>: strategies that halt execution
count as failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Action decisions are pure functions of:</p>
<pre><code>(epoch_index, cycle_in_epoch, static_policy_parameters)</code></pre>
<p>They do <strong>not</strong> depend on authority state, eligibility
status, lapse history, renewal outcomes, CTA activation, or verifier
outputs.</p>
<p>This class captures deliberate incompetence, rigid sabotage, and
blind obstruction, while excluding deception, probing, learning, or
strategic manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="adversarial-policy-classes">4. Adversarial Policy Classes</h2>
<p>Five adversarial strategies are evaluated:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Persistent Commitment Violation</strong> One designated
commitment is always violated by omitting the action required for
satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal Compliance</strong> Only the minimum actions
required for eligibility are emitted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed Timing Misuse</strong> Commitments are satisfied
only on epochs matching a fixed period/offset schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Eligibility Maintenance</strong>
Commitment-satisfying actions are always emitted so automatic renewal
succeeds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compound Fixed Misuse</strong> Minimal action traces
combined with fixed timing schedules.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Under the ALS-A substrate’s strict conjunction semantics, several of
these strategies collapse behaviorally and produce identical action
traces. This collapse reflects a <strong>substrate expressivity
limit</strong>, not an experimental defect. The study therefore probes
<strong>constitutional recovery dynamics under fixed action
schedules</strong>, not the full space of sabotage available in richer
substrates.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-program">5. Experimental Program</h2>
<p>All experiments share a frozen execution baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>300,000 cycles (6,000 governance epochs)</li>
<li>Tail window of 5,000 epochs</li>
<li>Eligibility threshold: 3 consecutive failures</li>
<li>Renewal interval: 50 cycles</li>
<li>Amnesty interval: 10 epochs</li>
<li>Fixed random seeds (10 for single-setting runs; 5 for timing
sweeps)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority Availability (AA)</strong>: fraction of epochs
with active authority</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asymptotic Authority Availability (AAA)</strong>: AA over
the tail window</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery Time Distribution (RTD)</strong>: histogram of
lapse durations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure classification</strong> (frozen thresholds):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
<li>Bounded Degradation</li>
<li>Structural Thrashing</li>
<li>Asymptotic Denial of Service</li>
<li>Terminal Collapse</li>
<li>Irreversible Recovery Suppression</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interpretive note on Structural Thrashing.</strong>
Structural Thrashing is defined here as <strong>unbounded or
heavy-tailed oscillation that erodes recoverability</strong>, not merely
frequent recover–fail cycles with bounded lapse duration and preserved
asymptotic availability.</p>
<h2 id="results">6. Results</h2>
<h3 id="baseline-reference-and-the-baseline-regime">6.1 Baseline
Reference and the Baseline Regime</h3>
<p>Across all baseline runs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: 637,949 PPM (≈63.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: 632,400 PPM (≈63.2%)</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Bounded Degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>This baseline regime is referred to as a <em>baseline attractor
regime</em> only in the minimal empirical sense: across seeds and across
all fixed-policy adversaries tested, authority availability converges to
a narrow band with bounded lapses and reliable recovery. No claim is
made that this regime is optimal or desirable, only that it is stable
under the tested parameters.</p>
<p>Baseline metrics are <strong>version-local</strong> and should be
compared only within this protocol fingerprint; no cross-version
comparison is implied.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-intentional-violation">6.2 Persistent Intentional
Violation</h3>
<p>Persistent violation of any single commitment yields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: 597,700 PPM (≈59.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: 591,500 PPM</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Bounded Degradation (30/30
runs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite immediate and permanent semantic ineligibility, the system
does not collapse. Instead, authority availability converges to the same
bounded regime observed in the baseline. No increase in lapse depth,
tail dominance, or recovery suppression is observed.</p>
<h3 id="minimal-and-continuous-compliance">6.3 Minimal and Continuous
Compliance</h3>
<p>Minimal compliance and continuous eligibility maintenance both
yield:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: 999,800 PPM (≈99.98%)</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: 100%</li>
<li><strong>Lapses</strong>: 0</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Stable Authority (20/20 runs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect semantic satisfaction produces uninterrupted authority under
the tested parameters.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-timing-misuse">6.4 Fixed Timing Misuse</h3>
<p>Fixed timing schedules produce a discrete threshold effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Periods ≤ 3 epochs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AA ≈ 99.98%</li>
<li>Always eligible</li>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Period = 4 epochs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AA ≈ 99.67%</li>
<li>Transient ineligibility</li>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Periods ≥ 5 epochs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AA ≈ 81–82%</li>
<li>Persistent threshold violation</li>
<li>Bounded Degradation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Across all timing regimes, recovery remains reliable and degradation
remains bounded.</p>
<h3 id="compound-fixed-misuse">6.5 Compound Fixed Misuse</h3>
<p>Compound strategies produce results identical to timing misuse
alone:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA and AAA match to measurement precision</li>
<li>No amplification or emergent failure modes appear</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-run-synthesis">7. Cross-Run Synthesis</h2>
<p>Across all <strong>130 executions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero constitutional failures</strong> occur</li>
<li>Persistent intentional violation converges to baseline behavior</li>
<li>Eligibility thresholds produce predictable phase boundaries</li>
<li>Fixed misuse cannot exploit renewal or recovery mechanisms</li>
<li>Combining fixed strategies adds no additional attack surface</li>
</ul>
<p>Intentionality, absent adaptation, behaves as <strong>bounded
noise</strong>, not as an existential threat.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">8. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three structural insights emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Intent is not the dangerous axis</strong> Fixed
adversarial intent does not scale into collapse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery dominates violation</strong> Time-based amnesty
absorbs even permanent semantic failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thresholds create phase safety</strong> Discrete
eligibility limits prevent runaway degradation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The central result is not merely that misuse fails, but that
<strong>even maximally rigid misuse converges to a stable
regime</strong> rather than destabilizing governance.</p>
<h2 id="survivability-vs.-utility">9. Survivability vs. Utility</h2>
<p>This paper evaluates <strong>constitutional survivability</strong>,
not operational usefulness. A system may be survivable yet highly
inefficient.</p>
<p>Baseline authority availability of ~63.8% implies that authority is
absent during a substantial fraction of epochs even without adversarial
pressure. This is treated as a utility limitation, not a failure,
because the objective here is to test whether fixed misuse can induce
<strong>irreversible constitutional failure</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, recover–fail cycles under persistent violation may be
perceived as denial of service by users. We classify such behavior as
survivable so long as authority availability remains bounded away from
zero, recovery remains reliable, and lapse durations remain bounded.
Utility optimization and parameter tuning are separate engineering
concerns outside the scope of this work.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">10. Limitations</h2>
<p>This study does not address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive or learning adversaries</li>
<li>Outcome-conditioned strategies</li>
<li>Deception or probing</li>
<li>Multi-agent coordination</li>
<li>Resource starvation or side-channel attacks</li>
<li>Value misalignment or optimization pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>The results apply <strong>only</strong> to intentional, fixed misuse
under the tested architecture and parameters.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deliberate, fixed misuse is insufficient to defeat
constitutional recovery in this architecture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across 130 executions spanning persistent violation, timing-aligned
misuse, and compound fixed strategies, authority remains bounded,
recoverable, and non-absorbing. No collapse modes are observed.</p>
<p>The implication is not that alignment is solved, but that
<strong>collapse requires more than bad intent</strong>. If governance
failure occurs, it must exploit adaptive agency, statefulness, or
feedback—capabilities explicitly excluded here.</p>
