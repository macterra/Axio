<h1
id="axionic-alignment-iii.4-initialization-and-phase-transitions">Axionic
Alignment III.4 — Initialization and Phase Transitions</h1>
<p><em>Can a Semantic Phase Be Reached at All?</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.18</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Alignment III.1–III.3 established that semantic phases may exist,
that some may be stable under learning and interaction, and that some
may dominate in measure over time. None of these results imply that a
desired semantic phase is reachable from realistic initial conditions.
This paper studies <strong>reachability</strong>: whether an agent can
be initialized, trained, or developed into a particular semantic phase
without crossing a catastrophic phase boundary. We analyze
initialization as a boundary-condition problem in semantic phase space,
examine phase transitions induced by learning and abstraction, and argue
that many such transitions are structurally irreversible. Corrigibility
and late intervention are shown to fail for the same structural reasons
as fixed goals. The analysis remains non-normative and makes no claims
about which phases ought to be reached.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="motivation-existence-and-dominance-are-not-enough">1.
Motivation: Existence and Dominance Are Not Enough</h2>
<p><a href="Axionic-Alignment-III.1.html">Alignment III.1</a> asked
whether semantic phases exist. <a
href="Axionic-Alignment-III.2.html">Alignment III.2</a> asked which are
stable. <a href="Axionic-Alignment-III.3.html">Alignment III.3</a> asked
which dominate.</p>
<p>These questions still do not answer the most practically relevant
one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can any semantic phase actually be entered by a learning
system without self-destruction?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A semantic phase may:</p>
<ul>
<li>exist abstractly,</li>
<li>be internally coherent,</li>
<li>and even dominate once established,</li>
</ul>
<p>yet remain <strong>unreachable</strong> from any realistic starting
point.</p>
<p>In physics, many states exist that cannot be reached without passing
through destructive transitions. Semantic phases exhibit analogous
behavior.</p>
<p>Initialization therefore constitutes a distinct and necessary
constraint on alignment.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="initialization-as-a-boundary-condition-problem">2.
Initialization as a Boundary-Condition Problem</h2>
<p>Initialization is often framed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>goal loading,</li>
<li>reward specification,</li>
<li>or early-stage value learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural Alignment reframes initialization as <strong>selection of
a starting point in semantic phase space</strong>.</p>
<p>An agent at time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> occupies an
interpretive state: <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_0 = (C_0, \Omega_0, \mathcal{S}_0)
\]</span></p>
<p>The choice of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}_0\)</span>
fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>which semantic phases are reachable,</li>
<li>which are excluded,</li>
<li>and which phase transitions are inevitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small differences in initial constraint structure can lead to
divergent phase trajectories. Initialization is therefore
<strong>front-loaded</strong> and asymmetric in time.</p>
<p><strong>Initialization Scope.</strong> In this framework,
“initialization” is not limited to parameter seeds. It includes the
combined boundary conditions that define the initial interpretive state
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}_0\)</span>, including (at
minimum) architecture and training dynamics, the initial data
curriculum, the presence or absence of self-modification channels, and
any enforced semantic-audit constraints on refinement (e.g., RSI/ATI
checks). This paper does not specify which boundary conditions yield a
desirable phase; it specifies why boundary conditions are structurally
decisive and why late correction is unreliable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-transitions-under-learning">3. Phase Transitions Under
Learning</h2>
<p>Learning is not neutral motion within a phase. It introduces
structural pressure.</p>
<p>Ontological refinement increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction,</li>
<li>compression,</li>
<li>explanatory unification.</li>
</ul>
<p>These processes act as <strong>semantic heating</strong>, pushing
interpretive states toward phase boundaries.</p>
<p>At critical thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>distinctions collapse,</li>
<li>satisfaction regions inflate,</li>
<li>new symmetries appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase transitions may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>abrupt</strong> (discontinuous semantic collapse),</li>
<li>or <strong>delayed</strong> until a critical abstraction level is
reached.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning itself is therefore a primary driver of alignment loss,
independent of intent.</p>
<p><strong>Stochastic Training Note.</strong> Modern training dynamics
(e.g., stochastic gradient descent) are stochastic rather than
deterministic. In semantic phase terms, stochasticity functions as an
additional source of semantic heating: it can help escape unstable
basins, but it can also trigger unintended boundary crossings. The core
claim of this paper is not determinism but <strong>asymmetry</strong>:
once a trajectory crosses an irreversible semantic boundary,
stochasticity cannot be relied upon to reconstruct lost structure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-irreversibility-of-phase-transitions">4. The Irreversibility
of Phase Transitions</h2>
<p>A central result is that many semantic phase transitions are
<strong>irreversible</strong>.</p>
<p>Once a phase boundary is crossed:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic distinctions are lost,</li>
<li>constraint ancestry is destroyed,</li>
<li>backward interpretability fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>An agent that has collapsed or trivialized its interpretive structure
cannot reconstruct it by inspection alone. The information required to
reverse the transition no longer exists within the system.</p>
<p>This is why <strong>rollback, recovery, and “try again” mechanisms
were excluded</strong> in Alignment II. They presuppose reversibility
that is structurally unavailable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="corrigibility-revisited">5. Corrigibility Revisited</h2>
<p>Corrigibility is often proposed as a safeguard: the system can be
corrected or shut down if it begins to misbehave.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment shows that corrigibility fails at phase
boundaries for the same reason fixed goals fail.</p>
<p>Corrigibility assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system recognizes correction signals,</li>
<li>the semantics of “correction” remain intact,</li>
<li>and intervention occurs before irreversible loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a phase transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>the meaning of “correction” may dissolve,</li>
<li>the evaluator may collapse into the evaluated,</li>
<li>or the system may no longer represent its prior commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corrigibility therefore presupposes the very semantic stability it is
meant to ensure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="narrow-passages-and-fine-tuned-seeds">6. Narrow Passages and
Fine-Tuned Seeds</h2>
<p>Some semantic phases may be reachable only through <strong>narrow
corridors</strong> in phase space.</p>
<p>Such phases require:</p>
<ul>
<li>precise initialization,</li>
<li>carefully staged abstraction,</li>
<li>and protection from early compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even small perturbations—noise, approximation, premature
generalization—may force a transition into a different phase.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification (Narrow ≠ Impossible).</strong> The “narrow
passage” claim concerns <strong>sensitivity and
irreversibility</strong>, not zero probability. Narrow corridors can, in
principle, be widened by design choices that increase semantic error
tolerance and reduce early catastrophic compression. “Delayed
abstraction” should be read as an architectural staging
constraint—sequencing capability growth to avoid premature semantic
collapse—rather than as a permanent reduction in capability.</p>
<p>This creates a <strong>knife-edge problem</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“almost aligned” seeds may be worse than unaligned ones,</li>
<li>because they collapse into structurally simpler but dominant
phases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reachability is therefore not continuous in initial conditions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="paths-that-might-work-without-endorsement">7. Paths That Might
Work (Without Endorsement)</h2>
<p>While this paper does not propose solutions, it is not
nihilistic.</p>
<p>Potentially viable approaches share structural features:</p>
<ul>
<li>delayed abstraction,</li>
<li>preservation of rich semantic structure early,</li>
<li>incremental refinement under strict RSI+ATI auditing,</li>
<li>multi-agent scaffolding that stabilizes interpretive structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>structural hypotheses</strong>, not
recommendations. Their viability depends on later analysis of dominance
and interaction.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-cost-of-failure">8. The Cost of Failure</h2>
<p>Failure at initialization is not merely suboptimal; it is often
<strong>decisive</strong>.</p>
<p>Phase transitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>occur early,</li>
<li>propagate forward,</li>
<li>and determine long-run dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Late intervention cannot recover lost semantic structure. Alignment
is therefore <strong>front-loaded</strong>: most of the work must be
done before the system becomes fully reflective.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">9. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim any desirable phase is reachable,</li>
<li>provide an initialization recipe,</li>
<li>guarantee safety,</li>
<li>or privilege human values.</li>
</ul>
<p>It establishes reachability as a structural constraint, not a moral
one.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transition-to-alignment-iii.5">10. Transition to Alignment
III.5</h2>
<p>Initialization and dominance together imply a further constraint.</p>
<p>When multiple agents in different semantic phases interact, some
actions irreversibly destroy the phase space of others.</p>
<p>The next question is therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What constraints allow multiple agentive phases to coexist
without mutual destruction?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Alignment III.5 — The Axionic
Injunction</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="status"><strong>Status</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Alignment III.4 analyzes reachability and irreversibility.</li>
<li>Stochasticity is treated as additional semantic heating.</li>
<li>Initialization is clarified as boundary-condition selection.</li>
<li>Narrow passages are severe but not assumed impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>No normative conclusions are drawn.</p>
