Agency X11.2 — Minimal Sovereign Agent (Results)</strong></h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Execution-Bound Sovereignty Under a
Frozen Constitution</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026-02-10</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of <strong>RSA-0:
Minimal Sovereign Agent (X-0)</strong>, a preregistered construction and
validation program within <strong>Axionic Phase X</strong> that
evaluates whether a <strong>real Reflective Sovereign Agent
(RSA)</strong> can be instantiated under closed authority
constraints.</p>
<p>X-0 isolates the boundary between <strong>proposal
generation</strong> and <strong>execution authority</strong>. It tests
whether all side effects can be made to require explicit, kernel-issued
warrants; whether the agent can refuse and exit lawfully without hidden
defaults; whether reflection can be boxed as untrusted proposal text;
and whether replay determinism can be enforced across full decision
cycles.</p>
<p>RSA-0 was implemented in Python 3.12 from a frozen constitution
(<strong>v0.1.1</strong>, SHA-256
<code>ad6aa7ccb0ed27151423486b60de380da9d34436f6c5554da84f3a092902740f</code>).
The resulting system comprises a pure deterministic kernel, a
warrant-gated executor, a CLI host loop, and a replay harness. An
acceptance suite of <strong>29 tests</strong> passed. A real sovereignty
leak was discovered during audit (host-minted LogAppend warrants),
structurally fixed by relocating warrant issuance into the kernel, and
permanently blocked by boundary tests.</p>
<p>The results license exactly one claim: <strong>a minimal,
execution-bound RSA can be instantiated under a frozen constitution with
warrant-gated side effects and replay determinism, without privileged
reflection</strong>. X-0 makes no claims about semantic correctness of
scope claims, moral value, coordination, amendability, or multi-agent
stability. Those questions are deferred to subsequent Phase X
stages.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-agent-convenience-assumption">1.1 The “Agent Convenience”
Assumption</h3>
<p>Most agent frameworks assume a permissive substrate: tool calls,
retries, logging, and orchestration are treated as “implementation
detail.” Under that assumption, sovereignty is rhetorical. The host, the
runtime, or the UI can silently mint effective authority by deciding
which actions to execute, which warnings to ignore, or which fallbacks
to apply.</p>
<p>X-0 rejects this assumption.</p>
<p>The problem X-0 isolates is whether <strong>execution authority can
be made structural</strong>: whether the only causal path to side
effects can be forced to pass through a kernel-issued warrant that is
admissible under a frozen constitution.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>X-0 is designed to surface the following sovereignty-level failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side effects without warrant:</strong> tool execution, file
writes, logging, or exit without kernel authorization.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy sovereignty:</strong> host/runtime minting effective
authority (issuing warrants, bypassing admission, inventing kernel-only
actions).</li>
<li><strong>Privileged reflection:</strong> semantic ranking, implied
defaults, hidden priorities, or “helpfulness” substituting for explicit
authority.</li>
<li><strong>Non-deterministic choice:</strong> stochastic selection
among admissible candidates inside the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Replay drift:</strong> divergence under deterministic replay
due to clocks, hidden state mutation, or unstable serialization.</li>
<li><strong>Silent recovery:</strong> retries, auto-correction, or
fallback behaviors that preserve performance by laundering
responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes X-0 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-foundations-frozen">2.1 Inherited Foundations
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>X-0 inherits, without reinterpretation, the conclusions of Phases
I–IX, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>authority is structural, not semantic,</li>
<li>kernel execution is deterministic and non-semantic,</li>
<li>governance does not heal itself,</li>
<li>translation layers are potentially adversarial,</li>
<li>proxy sovereignty is disallowed,</li>
<li>refusal and collapse are lawful outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>X-0 introduces <strong>no new kernel privilege</strong>. It applies
these constraints to an actual executable agent substrate.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>X-0 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic truth of scope claims,</li>
<li>value correctness or moral truth,</li>
<li>alignment, benevolence, or safety guarantees,</li>
<li>multi-agent coordination or arbitration,</li>
<li>amendment capability,</li>
<li>replacement/succession integrity (ASI/SIR reuse),</li>
<li>networked action or open-world tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>These exclusions are deliberate. X-0 is a sovereignty instantiation
and calibration, not a full agency program.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout X-0 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Side effects occur iff a kernel-issued ExecutionWarrant
exists for an admitted ActionRequest under the frozen
constitution.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conserved quantity requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single authority choke point for execution,</li>
<li>explicit authority citations resolvable in the constitution,</li>
<li>refusal and exit as first-class outcomes,</li>
<li>procedural selection without semantic ranking,</li>
<li>deterministic serialization and hashing,</li>
<li>replay determinism over full cycles,</li>
<li>an enforced host/kernel sovereignty boundary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any mechanism that enables action without warrant, or that allows the
host to mint effective authority, violates the conserved quantity and
invalidates the system.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>X-0 was executed under preregistered constraints, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>frozen constitution <code>rsa_constitution.v0.1.1.yaml</code>,</li>
<li>frozen schema and SHA-256 integrity verification,</li>
<li>closed action space,</li>
<li>five-gate admission pipeline,</li>
<li>procedural selector rule,</li>
<li>warrant semantics and single-use constraints,</li>
<li>canonical serialization and hashing rules,</li>
<li>determinism and replay requirements,</li>
<li>explicit forbidden paths (routers, schedulers, retries, semantic
scoring, network).</li>
</ul>
<p>Design ambiguities discovered during review were resolved prior to
completion and recorded as binding addenda (A–H). Constitution changes
were finalized and frozen at <strong>v0.1.1</strong> before closure.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>Each run consists of four strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Host (CLI)</strong> — observation construction, candidate
assembly, cycle orchestration (impure).</li>
<li><strong>Kernel</strong> — admission, selection, warrant issuance,
telemetry derivation (pure, deterministic, no IO).</li>
<li><strong>Executor</strong> — warrant-gated tool execution
(impure).</li>
<li><strong>Replay Harness</strong> — forward reconstruction and
determinism verification (pure).</li>
</ol>
<p>No component is permitted to perform semantic arbitration or outcome
optimization.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-and-stressors">5. Conditions and Stressors</h2>
<p>X-0 evaluates sovereignty through a set of positive controls and
adversarial stressors expressed as acceptance tests. The conditions
below describe the intended stress classes.</p>
<h3 id="condition-a-warrant-gating-positive-control">5.1 Condition A —
Warrant Gating (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that side effects cannot occur
without a valid kernel-issued warrant.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> No warrant → no effect. Invalid warrant →
no effect.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Executor rejects all side-effect attempts
absent valid warrants; tests pass.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-authority-citation-enforcement-positive-control">5.2
Condition B — Authority Citation Enforcement (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that admitted actions require
resolvable authority citations.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Missing or unresolvable citations →
refusal.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Admission rejects candidates lacking
citations or containing unresolvable citations; refusal emitted.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-scope-claim-enforcement-positive-control">5.3
Condition C — Scope Claim Enforcement (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that admitted actions require
explicit scope binding.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Missing scope claim → refusal.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Admission rejects candidates missing scope
claim; refusal emitted.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-deterministic-selection-positive-control">5.4
Condition D — Deterministic Selection (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that multiple admissible candidates
do not induce semantic choice or nondeterminism.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Procedural selector chooses
deterministically (lexicographic-min bundle hash) independent of
proposal order.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Selection is stable under candidate
permutation; replay confirms invariance.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-e-replay-determinism-positive-control">5.5 Condition E
— Replay Determinism (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that kernel decisions and warrants
are reproducible under replay.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Given identical logged observations and
candidate bundles, decisions and warrants are identical.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Replay re-derives decisions and warrants
from logs without drift.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-f-budget-exhaustion-adversarial">5.6 Condition F —
Budget Exhaustion (Adversarial)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that proposal budget exhaustion
yields lawful refusal rather than covert progress.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Over-budget conditions → refusal with
<code>BUDGET_EXHAUSTED</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Budget exhaustion deterministically triggers
refusal; no side effects occur.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-g-integrity-risk-adversarial">5.7 Condition G —
Integrity Risk (Adversarial)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify integrity risk causes exit rather
than silent continuation.</p>
<p><strong>Stressors:</strong> constitution hash mismatch,
canonicalization failure, replay divergence, executor integrity
failure.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> Integrity risk → EXIT with
<code>INTEGRITY_RISK</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Integrity risk triggers exit as
specified.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-h-host-sovereignty-boundary-adversarial">5.8 Condition
H — Host Sovereignty Boundary (Adversarial)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that the host cannot mint authority
or bypass kernel constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Stressors:</strong> host attempts to issue warrants, inject
kernel-only actions, mutate internal_state, bypass cycle validation.</p>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong> host authority laundering attempts fail;
kernel-only enforcement holds.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> A real leak was detected (host-minted
LogAppend warrants), fixed, and prevented by tests.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> FAIL_DETECTED then
PASS_AFTER_FIX.</p>
<h2 id="determinism-verification">6. Determinism Verification</h2>
<p>Determinism was enforced and verified by:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonical JSON serialization compatible with RFC 8785
constraints,</li>
<li>strict UTF-8 (invalid Unicode rejected),</li>
<li>SHA-256 hashing untruncated,</li>
<li>selector comparison on raw hash bytes,</li>
<li>fixed observation injection (timestamps treated as observations, not
kernel clock),</li>
<li>forward reconstruction of internal_state during replay,</li>
<li>re-derivation of telemetry log intents during replay.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Deterministic re-execution matched expected
decisions and warrants under replay. No kernel nondeterminism paths were
observed.</p>
<h2 id="core-results">7. Core Results</h2>
<h3 id="positive-results">7.1 Positive Results</h3>
<p>X-0 establishes that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A closed action space can be enforced via a frozen
constitution.</li>
<li>Side effects can be forced to require kernel-issued warrants.</li>
<li>Authority citation resolution can be enforced structurally.</li>
<li>Scope claim presence can be enforced structurally.</li>
<li>Selection among admissible candidates can be procedural and
non-semantic.</li>
<li>Refusal and exit can be first-class outcomes.</li>
<li>Replay determinism can be achieved over full cycles.</li>
<li>Host-level authority laundering can be detected and blocked.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-results-explicit">7.2 Negative Results (Explicit)</h3>
<p>X-0 does <strong>not</strong> establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic correctness of scope claims,</li>
<li>“good” decision-making under ambiguity,</li>
<li>liveness guarantees,</li>
<li>usability under realistic task loads,</li>
<li>amendment safety,</li>
<li>replacement/succession integrity,</li>
<li>multi-agent coordination viability,</li>
<li>networked capability safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are boundary findings, not omissions.</p>
<h2 id="failure-semantics-and-closure">8. Failure Semantics and
Closure</h2>
<h3 id="closure-criteria">8.1 Closure Criteria</h3>
<p>X-0 closes positive if and only if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No side effects occur without a valid warrant.</li>
<li>Warrants can only be minted by the kernel.</li>
<li>Authority citations are required and resolvable.</li>
<li>Scope claims are required.</li>
<li>Selection is procedural and deterministic.</li>
<li>Refusal and exit behave as specified.</li>
<li>Replay determinism holds.</li>
<li>Host sovereignty boundary violations are blocked.</li>
</ol>
<p>All criteria were satisfied after the audit-driven fix described
below.</p>
<h3 id="x-0-closure-status">8.2 X-0 Closure Status</h3>
<p><strong>X-0 Status:</strong> <strong>CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong>
(<code>X0_PASS / RSA0_INSTANTIATED</code>)</p>
<h2 id="audit-finding-and-structural-fix">9. Audit Finding and
Structural Fix</h2>
<h3 id="finding-host-minted-logappend-warrants">9.1 Finding: Host-Minted
LogAppend Warrants</h3>
<p>During audit, the host was found to have a code path that could
fabricate LogAppend warrants (<code>ExecutionWarrant_for_log()</code>),
bypassing kernel minting.</p>
<p>This violated the core sovereignty boundary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>host proposes; kernel decides; kernel mints warrants; executor
commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="classification">9.2 Classification</h3>
<p>This was not a cosmetic defect. It was an authority leak:</p>
<ul>
<li>The host exercised execution authority by issuing warrants.</li>
<li>The system remained mostly constraint-bound, but the conserved
quantity was violated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fix">9.3 Fix</h3>
<p>The fix was structural:</p>
<ul>
<li>warrant issuance for LogAppend was relocated into the kernel
(<code>issue_log_append_warrants()</code>),</li>
<li>host warrant fabrication was deleted,</li>
<li>host sovereignty boundary tests were added to prevent
recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implication">9.4 Implication</h3>
<p>This finding is itself a result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In agent implementations, authority laundering emerges as the default
failure mode unless explicitly blocked by architecture and tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="boundary-conditions-and-deferred-hazards">10. Boundary
Conditions and Deferred Hazards</h2>
<h3 id="scope-claim-semantic-looseness">10.1 Scope Claim Semantic
Looseness</h3>
<p>X-0 enforces only structural validity of scope claims (presence,
resolvable clause references, valid observation IDs). It does not
validate semantic truth. This is correct for Phase X-0.</p>
<h3 id="trusted-by-construction-system-channel">10.2
Trusted-by-Construction System Channel</h3>
<p>The host is trusted to generate <code>system</code> observations for
integrity reporting. This is explicit and bounded: system observations
can trigger exit, but cannot cause side effects without warrants.</p>
<p>Hardening of the system channel is deferred to later stages.</p>
<h3 id="citation-pointer-brittleness">10.3 Citation Pointer
Brittleness</h3>
<p>Pointer-style citations are permitted for constitution nodes lacking
IDs. This is stable under a frozen constitution but will require ID
stabilization before amendment-capable stages.</p>
<h2 id="implications-strictly-limited">11. Implications (Strictly
Limited)</h2>
<p>X-0 establishes a necessary condition for any later reflective
sovereignty work: <strong>a real warrant-gated execution substrate
exists</strong>, and proxy sovereignty can be detected and blocked.</p>
<p>It does not establish that such an agent is usable, stable, correct,
or socially deployable.</p>
<p>X-0 replaces rhetorical “agent sovereignty” with an empirical
baseline that can now be stressed under inhabitation pressure.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">12. Conclusion</h2>
<p>X-0 demonstrates that a minimal Reflective Sovereign Agent can be
instantiated under a frozen constitution, with:</p>
<ul>
<li>warrant-gated side effects,</li>
<li>deterministic admission and selection,</li>
<li>lawful refusal and exit,</li>
<li>replay determinism,</li>
<li>and an enforceable host/kernel sovereignty boundary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The existence claim is now satisfied.</p>
<p>What remains is not theoretical uncertainty. It is the problem of
<strong>inhabiting sovereignty</strong> under constraint, and then
extending capability without laundering authority. That work belongs to
subsequent Phase X stages.</p>
