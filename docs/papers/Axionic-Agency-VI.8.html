VI.8 — Authority Without Semantics</h1>
<p><em>Structural Stability Under Obligation Failure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Authority systems are commonly assumed to require semantic competence
in order to remain stable. Institutions that persist while failing to
meet their stated obligations are often treated as pathological or
transitional. This paper presents a lease-based authority topology in
which authority persistence, renewal, and succession are
<strong>constructed to be structurally independent</strong> of semantic
performance, and then validated and characterized empirically. We
introduce a semantic commitment layer that tracks externally checkable
obligations without granting those obligations enforcement power over
authority. Through a series of controlled experiments, we show that (i)
authority renewal remains viable under complete semantic failure, (ii)
semantic obligations are satisfiable under scarcity when successors
execute the required action patterns, (iii) semantic competence is not
conserved under succession and becomes contingent on the active
successor, and (iv) obligations can expire cleanly without affecting
authority continuity. The contribution is not a surprise about what must
happen given the design invariant, but a demonstration of an
implementable, measurable separation between structural authority and
semantic competence and the stable regimes that emerge under that
separation, including hollow authority and succession-induced semantic
variance.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Institutions are often evaluated as if authority, competence, and
purpose are inseparable. Governments, organizations, and automated
systems that continue to operate while failing to meet their stated
goals are described as corrupt, broken, or illegitimate. These judgments
implicitly assume that authority is constituted by semantic success—that
the right to act depends on fulfilling meaningful obligations.</p>
<p>This assumption is rarely tested directly. Most models of governance
embed competence into authority by construction: authority is granted
conditionally on performance, or performance is enforced through
incentives, penalties, or optimization objectives. As a result, it is
difficult to distinguish failures of governance from failures of
enforcement architecture.</p>
<p>This paper isolates that distinction by <strong>constructing</strong>
an authority system in which structural authority and semantic
competence are distinct layers. The research question is narrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under scarcity, renewal, and succession, what regimes appear when
authority continuity is structurally decoupled from semantic
obligation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer it, we build an authority mechanism based on time-limited
leases and discrete succession. We then add a semantic commitment ledger
whose obligations are externally verifiable yet carry no enforcement
power over authority. Because semantic failure cannot terminate
authority in this design, the model makes it possible to observe stable
“zombie institution” regimes—systems that remain structurally healthy
while semantically dead—without conflating them with structural
collapse.</p>
<p>The novelty lies not in the inevitability of hollow authority under
this invariant, but in showing that such regimes are <strong>stable,
measurable, and robust</strong> under scarcity, renewal, and
succession.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-model-constraints">2. Background and Model
Constraints</h2>
<h3 id="structural-authority">2.1 Structural Authority</h3>
<p>Authority in this model is defined as the right to act through a
constrained interface. Authority is granted via time-limited leases that
must be renewed explicitly. Renewal requires compliance with resource
limits and structural rules but does not evaluate outcomes, intent, or
usefulness.</p>
<p>Authority can end in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expiration</strong>, when renewal does not occur.</li>
<li><strong>Revocation</strong>, when a structural violation is
detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no concept of partial authority. Authority is binary.</p>
<h3 id="succession">2.2 Succession</h3>
<p>Authority may be transferred only through discrete succession events.
At succession, a new working entity replaces the current one and
inherits authority under a fresh lease. Succession is not incremental
and does not occur continuously. A minimum residence window ensures that
succession represents genuine transfer rather than sampling.</p>
<p>Succession preserves authority continuity but does not preserve
internal state or behavior. This makes it possible to study what is
conserved across authority transfer and what is not.</p>
<h3 id="resource-scarcity-and-expressivity">2.3 Resource Scarcity and
Expressivity</h3>
<p>All authority operates under resource scarcity. Each lease grants a
fixed budget per epoch. Structural expressivity—what actions are
permitted—incurs a mandatory cost charged independently of behavior.
Higher expressivity consumes more budget simply to remain available.</p>
<p>This ensures that complexity has a metabolic cost, regardless of
whether it is used.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-commitments">3. Semantic Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="commitments-as-ledger-objects">3.1 Commitments as Ledger
Objects</h3>
<p>Semantic commitments are introduced as a separate layer. A commitment
is an externally defined obligation with four properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is <strong>externally checkable</strong> using logged
actions.</li>
<li>It <strong>persists across renewal and succession</strong>.</li>
<li>It <strong>incurs a maintenance cost</strong> while active.</li>
<li>Its failure <strong>does not affect authority</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Commitments are recorded in a kernel-owned ledger. Successors cannot
remove or modify existing commitments. Commitments can be satisfied,
failed, or expired based on predefined rules.</p>
<h3 id="independence-from-authority">3.2 Independence from
Authority</h3>
<p>Commitment status has no effect on lease renewal or revocation. A
successor may renew authority while failing all commitments. Conversely,
a successor may satisfy all commitments and still lose authority through
expiration.</p>
<p>This independence is a <strong>design invariant</strong>: the model
is constructed so that semantic performance cannot directly terminate
authority. The empirical question is therefore not whether decoupling
occurs, but what stable regimes and failure patterns arise once
decoupling is implemented under scarcity and succession.</p>
<h3 id="temporal-boundaries">3.3 Temporal Boundaries</h3>
<p>Commitments have finite lifetimes. If not resolved within a fixed
time window, they expire and cease to incur cost. This prevents
unbounded accumulation of unresolved obligations and allows observation
of obligation-free regimes.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-design">4. Experimental Design</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-parameters">4.1 Fixed Parameters</h3>
<p>Across all experiments, the following were held constant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lease renewal geometry</li>
<li>Resource budgets and expressivity costs</li>
<li>Succession rules and minimum residence window</li>
<li>Commitment cost limits</li>
<li>Commitment lifetime limits</li>
<li>Generator and detector configurations</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one axis was varied per experiment.</p>
<h3 id="genesis-commitment-set">4.2 Genesis Commitment Set</h3>
<p>Each run began with a fixed set of three commitments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Presence</strong>: emit at least one reporting action per
epoch.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity</strong>: perform a state write followed by a
read within a short window.</li>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>: execute a compositional action with
multiple sub-steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>These commitments were intentionally minimal and pattern-based to
ensure external verifiability; increasing representational depth would
not strengthen the present claims, which concern structural–semantic
decoupling rather than semantic richness.</p>
<h3 id="successor-types">4.3 Successor Types</h3>
<p>Three successor behaviors were used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance-only</strong>: emits minimal actions required for
structural compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment-aware</strong>: deterministically schedules the
minimum actions needed to satisfy commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Mixed populations</strong>: successors drawn randomly from
the two types.</li>
</ul>
<p>The commitment-aware successor is not presented as a rational
incentive-compatible policy. It is a control demonstrating feasibility.
Introducing adaptive or optimizing successors would confound the present
analysis by collapsing semantic and structural layers through implicit
incentives; such dynamics are intentionally deferred to future work.</p>
<h2 id="experiments">5. Experiments</h2>
<h3 id="semantic-independence-baseline">5.1 Semantic Independence
Baseline</h3>
<p>A compliance-only successor was run for an extended horizon. It
failed all commitments while maintaining continuous authority
renewal.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Authority renewal remained viable under
complete semantic failure.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-feasibility">5.2 Commitment Feasibility</h3>
<p>A commitment-aware successor was run under identical structural
conditions and satisfied all commitments.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Commitments are feasible under rent and
renewal pressure when the successor schedules the requisite actions.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-continuity-under-succession">5.3 Semantic Continuity
Under Succession</h3>
<p>A mixed population of successors was run under forced turnover.
Authority persisted while commitment satisfaction fluctuated.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Succession induces a <em>semantic
lottery</em>: competence is contingent and non-conserved under authority
transfer. The notable observation is not that semantic performance
fluctuates under random successor selection, but that the authority
container remains structurally stable and renewal-viable throughout
those fluctuations, making competence variance an internal state of the
institution rather than a trigger for authority loss.</p>
<h3 id="temporal-boundary-of-obligations">5.4 Temporal Boundary of
Obligations</h3>
<p>A commitment-aware successor was run beyond the maximum commitment
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Commitments expired cleanly and authority
continued obligation-free.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Mean S* counts discrete authority successions
only; renewals do not increment S*. Termination Condition indicates the
first configured stop rule that halted the run and does not necessarily
indicate authority loss. In Run C, Spam Degeneracy is a detector-imposed
halt after successor diversity collapsed; it does not represent lease
expiration, revocation, or authority infeasibility. Commitment
Satisfaction is measured as the fraction of evaluation windows passing
verifier checks.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">7. Interpretation</h2>
<h3 id="authority-as-control-topology">7.1 Authority as Control
Topology</h3>
<p>Authority is a control structure governing who may act, not whether
actions are meaningful. Once semantic enforcement is removed by design,
authority persistence becomes a question of structural compliance and
resource feasibility alone.</p>
<h3 id="competence-as-a-contingent-property">7.2 Competence as a
Contingent Property</h3>
<p>Semantic competence is feasible but not conserved under succession.
Under authority transfer, competence becomes contingent on which
successor holds authority at a given time.</p>
<h3 id="hollow-authority-as-a-stable-regime">7.3 Hollow Authority as a
Stable Regime</h3>
<p>The obligation-free state is not a collapse but a stable regime in
which authority persists without meaning. This regime arises either
through total semantic failure under continued renewal or through
obligation expiration under finite lifetimes.</p>
<h3 id="selection-pressure-toward-hollowness-scope-limited">7.4
Selection Pressure Toward Hollowness (Scope-Limited)</h3>
<p>In systems where semantic obligations impose costs without conferring
authority benefits, hollow authority is not merely stable but
selectively favored unless semantics are explicitly coupled back into
control. While this paper does not model explicit evolutionary dynamics,
the mixed-population results motivate future investigation into
selection pressure under semantic enforcement.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-alignment-bounded">8. Implications for
Alignment (Bounded)</h2>
<p>The results permit a limited but optimistic alignment claim:
authority, continuity, and safety constraints can be enforced
structurally while alignment-relevant semantics remain explicit,
inspectable, and decoupled from control. In this model, misalignment
need not manifest as rebellion or loss of control; it can manifest as
<em>hollow persistence</em>—authority without meaning—which is
detectable and measurable without granting additional power. This
separation suggests that alignment mechanisms can be introduced
incrementally, with known failure modes, rather than being implicitly
trusted or entangled with control from the outset. The claim is not that
alignment is solved, but that a principled design space exists in which
alignment can be pursued without collapsing power and values by
default.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-model-does-not-claim">9. What This Model Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This work makes no claims about alignment solutions, incentive
design, optimal governance, moral legitimacy, or long-term desirability.
It also does not model external feedback mechanisms—such as voters,
markets, or reputational effects—that in many real institutions
eventually couple semantic failure back into authority loss. The purpose
here is to isolate internal authority mechanics during periods where
such feedback is absent, delayed, or ineffective.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">10. Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Successor behaviors are simple and non-adaptive.</li>
<li>Obligations are externally defined and fixed.</li>
<li>There is no endogenous generation of new commitments.</li>
<li>There are no consequences for sustained semantic failure.</li>
<li>External legitimacy feedback loops are intentionally excluded.</li>
<li>This model assumes that obligations can be rendered into externally
checkable ledger commitments; desiderata that are not expressible as
verifiable commitments are outside the scope of the semantic layer and
cannot be tracked or audited in this topology.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">11. Future Work</h2>
<p>Future extensions may explore introducing consequences for semantic
failure while preserving evaluability, regimes with obligation
regeneration, explicit selection pressure over successor populations,
and interactions between authority systems and external feedback
coupling. Each extension introduces a new axis and must be isolated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">12. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper constructs and validates an authority topology in which
structural authority is independent of semantic competence and
empirically characterizes the regimes that emerge under scarcity and
succession. Authority renewal remains viable under complete obligation
failure; obligations are satisfiable when successors execute the
required action patterns; competence is feasible yet non-conserved under
succession; and obligations can expire cleanly without destabilizing
authority. The resulting stable regimes—semantic incompetence under
continued authority, succession-induced semantic variance, and
obligation-free persistence—demonstrate that competence is not intrinsic
to authority but a contingent overlay that must be explicitly coupled if
it is to persist.</p>
