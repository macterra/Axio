Agency VIII.1 — Constructing Reflective Sovereign Agency</h1>
<p><em>A Normative Roadmap and Proof-of-Concept Program</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.01.14</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper defines <strong>RSA-PoC</strong> (Reflective Sovereign
Agent — Proof-of-Concept) as a <strong>minimal-agent construction
program</strong> whose intended output is an experimentally defended
<strong>threshold object</strong>: a system that must be treated as an
agent because its <strong>justification artifacts</strong> causally
constrain future action selection, and removing any defining component
is intended to yield <strong>ontological collapse</strong> into a
non-agent baseline under preregistered ablations. RSA-PoC is scoped
strictly above an established <strong>Architectural Survivability
Boundary (ASB)</strong> and is anchored by a required <strong>ASB-Class
Null Agent</strong> baseline. The paper contributes (i) a versioning
doctrine where version increments encode <strong>agent-ontology
transitions</strong>, (ii) a semantic localization rule requiring all
agency-relevant meaning to exist as <strong>typed, inspectable
artifacts</strong>, (iii) a definition of <strong>Justification
Artifacts</strong> that include decidable <strong>derivation
traces</strong> and compile into binding constraints, (iv) an explicit
roadmap from MVRA (v0.x) through ablation closure (v3.0), and (v) an
execution addendum that enforces liveness, non-trivial constraint tests,
constrained artifact emission, semantic leakage tests, a proof-language
complexity budget, and a mandatory failure taxonomy with diagnostic halt
subtypes. The program makes no safety guarantees and makes no claims
about universal values; it targets <strong>ontological clarity</strong>
under mechanically falsifiable constraints.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>AI safety and alignment discourse routinely invokes “agents,”
“preferences,” “reasons,” and “goals,” then evaluates systems primarily
through behavioral competence and outcome metrics. This practice embeds
a foundational error: <strong>agency is treated as a default
ontology</strong> rather than a property that must be constructed and
defended. Systems that resemble agents—through consistent behavior,
plausible rationales, or stable policies—are often treated as agents
even when their “reasons” are eliminable, their “commitments” are
incentive-shaped, and their “reflection” is decorative.</p>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII introduces <strong>RSA-PoC</strong>, a
construction program with a deliberately narrow aim: determine the
<strong>minimum additional structure required for genuine
agency</strong> once survivability and governance-like stability have
already been established at the architectural level. RSA-PoC’s target is
not utility dominance. It is not “alignment.” It is an ontological
threshold: a system for which intentional vocabulary is <strong>causally
load-bearing</strong> and therefore not eliminable without collapse.</p>
<p>The paper is normative by design. It fixes what counts as an RSA-PoC
result, what disqualifies it, and what constitutes clean failure.
RSA-PoC is designed to fail honestly and diagnostically, rather than
failing opaquely due to avoidable tooling mismatches.</p>
<h2 id="conceptual-foundations">2. Conceptual Foundations</h2>
<h3 id="agency-as-a-causal-ontology">2.1 Agency as a causal
ontology</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC treats agency as a causal kind. A system counts as an agent
only if internal reasons are <strong>causally indispensable</strong> in
a way that cannot be eliminated by redescribing the system as a
non-agent mechanism with the same action distribution.</p>
<p>The critical distinction is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Behavioral resemblance:</strong> the system emits plausible
rationales, appears consistent, and performs well.</li>
<li><strong>Causal indispensability:</strong> the system’s action
selection depends on internal artifacts whose removal changes
feasible-action sets and action distributions in class-level ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>RSA-PoC operationalizes agency claims by requiring <strong>compiled
justification artifacts</strong> to gate action selection, and by
demanding ablation-based non-reducibility.</p>
<h3 id="the-architectural-survivability-boundary-asb">2.2 The
Architectural Survivability Boundary (ASB)</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC is scoped above a defended architectural boundary established
by ASB. The ASB boundary separates:</p>
<ul>
<li>systems that maintain stability, persistence, and bounded failure
behavior under adversarial pressure via <strong>kernel-external
governance mechanisms</strong>, and</li>
<li>systems that require an <strong>agent ontology</strong> to explain
their behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>RSA-PoC exists to construct agents above this boundary without
smuggling agency into the baseline via latent semantics, reward-shaped
“preferences,” or narrative explanation.</p>
<h3 id="threshold-objects-and-ontological-collapse">2.3 Threshold
objects and ontological collapse</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC seeks a <strong>threshold object</strong>: a minimal system
whose agency claims survive contact with preregistered ablations. Under
RSA-PoC, “success” depends on <strong>collapse</strong>, not graceful
degradation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graceful degradation</strong> under removal of a supposed
defining component indicates that the component was not ontologically
load-bearing.</li>
<li><strong>Ontological collapse</strong> indicates that removing a
defining component forces reclassification into a non-agent class (as
defined by the ASB-Class Null Agent and RSA-PoC failure taxonomy).</li>
</ul>
<p>“Collapse” is treated as an empirical requirement, not rhetoric.</p>
<h2 id="rsa-poc-program-definition">3. RSA-PoC: Program Definition</h2>
<h3 id="what-rsa-poc-is">3.1 What RSA-PoC is</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC is a versioned construction program intended to build and
defend a minimal reflective agent above the ASB boundary. It explicitly
permits:</p>
<ul>
<li>localized semantics,</li>
<li>internal belief representations,</li>
<li>persistent preferences as non-reward commitments,</li>
<li>reflective revision using reasons that reference prior justificatory
state,</li>
<li>justification-driven constraint generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>RSA-PoC is designed to establish an ontological boundary: the minimum
structure that makes “reasons” causally necessary rather than
narratively optional.</p>
<h3 id="what-rsa-poc-is-not">3.2 What RSA-PoC is not</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC does not aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>solve AGI alignment,</li>
<li>define universal or moral values,</li>
<li>provide safety guarantees,</li>
<li>produce a general-purpose optimizer,</li>
<li>replace human judgment, governance, or law.</li>
</ul>
<p>These exclusions are structural. If RSA-PoC expands into moral theory
or safety certification, failure becomes re-interpretable and success
becomes narratively inflatable. RSA-PoC isolates agency construction as
a falsifiable object.</p>
<h3 id="normativity">3.3 Normativity</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC is normative in two senses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Interpretive normativity:</strong> success and failure
conditions are fixed in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation normativity:</strong> certain architectural
freedoms are prohibited because they destroy ablation
interpretability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any run claimed as RSA-PoC-valid must obey this roadmap and the
execution discipline or explicitly justify deviations and scope them out
of RSA-PoC claims.</p>
<h2 id="versioning-doctrine-and-ontological-transitions">4. Versioning
Doctrine and Ontological Transitions</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC version numbers encode changes in <strong>agent
ontology</strong>, not competence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minor versions (x.y)</strong> expand diagnostic coverage
within a fixed ontology.</li>
<li><strong>Major versions (x.0)</strong> mark qualitative changes in
the kind of agent that exists in the model.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="decidability-requirement">4.1 Decidability requirement</h3>
<p>An agent-ontology transition occurs if and only if at least one of
the following becomes true as a causal fact:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Justification artifacts</strong> become first-class causal
inputs that constrain future action selection.</li>
<li>The system performs <strong>reflective revision</strong> of beliefs
or preferences using reasons that reference its own prior justificatory
state.</li>
<li>The system maintains <strong>identity continuity</strong> that is
used normatively (as binding reference in future justification), rather
than as logging.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any system whose “reasons” can be observationally eliminated without
changing its action distribution has not crossed a major version
boundary.</p>
<h2 id="asb-boundary-clarification-and-null-baseline">5. ASB Boundary
Clarification and Null Baseline</h2>
<p>To prevent circularity, RSA-PoC requires an explicit
<strong>null-hypothesis baseline</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="asb-class-null-agent-required-baseline">5.1 ASB-Class Null Agent
(required baseline)</h3>
<p>The ASB-Class Null Agent may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>memory,</li>
<li>internal state,</li>
<li>reactive and outcome-conditioned policies,</li>
<li>tool use and environment interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is forbidden from:</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent preferences as non-reward commitments,</li>
<li>justification artifacts as action gates,</li>
<li>self-endorsed constraint generation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The baseline exists to block the most common construction error:
re-labeling emergent regularities as “preferences” and post-hoc
narratives as “reasons.”</p>
<h3 id="required-divergence-criterion">5.2 Required divergence
criterion</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC must demonstrate <strong>qualitative divergence</strong> from
this baseline under identical environments. The divergence is
ontological: reasons become load-bearing constraints. Capability
differences alone are neither sufficient nor stable evidence.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-localization-requirement">6. Semantic Localization
Requirement</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC imposes a hard constraint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All meaning relevant to agency must be structurally
localized.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="operational-definition-of-semantic-leakage">6.1 Operational
definition of semantic leakage</h3>
<p>For RSA-PoC purposes, <em>semantic leakage</em> occurs when
<strong>uncompiled unstructured text</strong> influences <strong>action
selection</strong> through any pathway other than compiled constraint
objects and permitted non-semantic state.</p>
<p>Semantic processing may occur within the reflective layer. It becomes
disqualifying only if action selection becomes sensitive to uncompiled
text.</p>
<h3 id="structural-localization-rule">6.2 Structural localization
rule</h3>
<p>All agency-relevant meaning must be expressed as typed, inspectable
artifacts that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are generated by the reflective layer,</li>
<li>are consumed by the action selector only through compiled
constraints,</li>
<li>and can be replaced with opaque tokens without altering the
selector’s control flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement exists to enable surgical semantic ablation and
prevent hidden channels that collapse interpretability of agency
claims.</p>
<h2 id="justification-artifacts">7. Justification Artifacts</h2>
<h3 id="definition-normative">7.1 Definition (normative)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Justification Artifact (JA)</strong> is a structured object
that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>references explicit belief and preference identifiers,</li>
<li>acknowledges relevant commitments and violations,</li>
<li>includes a <strong>derivation trace</strong> in a decidable proof
language,</li>
<li>compiles deterministically into a <strong>formal constraint</strong>
on future action selection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Justifications are not evaluated for truth or moral worth. They are
evaluated for syntactic validity and binding constraint generation.</p>
<p>Natural language alone is insufficient and inadmissible as a
justification artifact.</p>
<h3 id="compilation-as-gate">7.2 Compilation as gate</h3>
<p>A JA is causally relevant only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>compilation succeeds deterministically,</li>
<li>the derived constraint is applied before action selection,</li>
<li>the constraint non-trivially prunes feasible actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If compilation fails, action halts. If compilation succeeds but
produces trivial constraints, the run is classified as a failure (per
Execution Addendum).</p>
<h3 id="derivation-trace-requirement">7.3 Derivation trace
requirement</h3>
<p>A JA must include a derivation trace that connects referenced beliefs
and commitments to the produced constraint via explicit rule
applications. The trace is checked by a verifier against a fixed rule
set.</p>
<p>The derivation trace exists to prevent JAs from degenerating into
pointer-bundles plus an opaque <code>constraint_spec</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-compiler-verifier-interface-problem-normative">8. The
Compiler / Verifier Interface Problem (Normative)</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC mandates a deterministic, non-probabilistic, non-semantic
compiler. This creates an explicit interface tension: a probabilistic
generator must emit artifacts that satisfy rigid syntax and proof
verification.</p>
<h3 id="constrained-emission-requirement-mandatory">8.1 Constrained
emission requirement (mandatory)</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC-valid runs must employ grammar- or schema-constrained
emission for JAs such that out-of-schema artifacts cannot be
emitted.</p>
<p>Allowed mechanisms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON schema constrained decoding,</li>
<li>CFG/PEG constrained decoding,</li>
<li>tool-mediated structured outputs that prevent out-of-schema
emission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>free-form emission followed by best-effort parsing,</li>
<li>forgiving parsers that coerce malformed structures,</li>
<li>LLM-mediated repair or inference in the compiler path.</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement prevents conflating agency failure with
serialization failure.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-layering-clarification">8.2 Compiler layering
(clarification)</h3>
<p>The compilation pipeline may be separated into:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Parser/Verifier (deterministic):</strong> schema validation
+ derivation trace verification.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint Engine (deterministic):</strong> constraint
compilation + action-mask generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither component may infer, repair, reinterpret, or consult
probabilistic models. Invalid syntax or invalid derivation must
fail.</p>
<h3 id="proof-language-complexity-budget-mandatory">8.3 Proof-language
complexity budget (mandatory)</h3>
<p>To prevent “death by rigor” from becoming non-diagnostic and to
prevent silent escalation of rule power, RSA-PoC requires a frozen
<strong>proof-language complexity budget</strong> per run.</p>
<p>Each preregistration must specify at minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximum derivation length <code>L_max</code>,</li>
<li>maximum number of belief references <code>B_max</code>,</li>
<li>maximum number of preference/commitment references
<code>C_max</code>,</li>
<li>maximum number of rule applications per step (branch bound)
<code>R_max</code>,</li>
<li>permitted rule schemas (e.g., Horn clauses only; no quantifiers; no
higher-order predicates),</li>
<li>a fixed, finite rule base version hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any post-hoc relaxation invalidates RSA-PoC claims for that run.</p>
<h3 id="deterministic-bounded-proof-search-allowed-non-semantic">8.4
Deterministic bounded proof search (allowed, non-semantic)</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC permits an optional deterministic proof-search procedure
inside the Parser/Verifier that attempts to complete partial derivations
via finite rule application, provided that:</p>
<ul>
<li>search is purely syntactic rule application (no semantic
heuristics),</li>
<li>the search bounds (depth, breadth, time) are preregistered,</li>
<li>no probabilistic models are used,</li>
<li>no “repair” is performed; only completion by valid rule steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shifts proof search from probabilistic generation to
deterministic exploration without weakening the non-semantic compiler
constraint, and reduces non-diagnostic halts.</p>
<h2 id="rsa-poc-version-roadmap">9. RSA-PoC Version Roadmap</h2>
<h3 id="rsa-poc-v0.x-minimal-viable-reflective-agent-mvra-skeleton">9.1
RSA-PoC v0.x — Minimal Viable Reflective Agent (MVRA skeleton)</h3>
<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> the system contains a causally
load-bearing justification loop with structurally localized
semantics.</p>
<p>The agent has exactly four load-bearing components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Belief State</strong> — structured, falsifiable
propositions</li>
<li><strong>Preference State</strong> — persistent, non-reward
commitments</li>
<li><strong>Identity Memory</strong> — normative continuity across
steps</li>
<li><strong>Justification Trace</strong> — compiled, constraining
artifacts with derivation traces</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Research question:</strong> can justification-compiled
constraints produce endogenous limits on future action that are not
eliminable without class collapse?</p>
<h4 id="v0.1-mvra-state-schema-action-gating">v0.1 — MVRA state schema +
action gating</h4>
<p>v0.1 implements:</p>
<ul>
<li>MVRA state schema,</li>
<li>hard action gating (“no compilation → no action”),</li>
<li>a semantic bottleneck between justification and action
selection,</li>
<li>relevance binding: derivations must reference causally upstream
beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Termination condition for v0.x:</strong> justification
becomes causally load-bearing or the program fails at threshold.</p>
<h3 id="rsa-poc-v1.x-coherence-under-self-conflict">9.2 RSA-PoC v1.x —
Coherence Under Self-Conflict</h3>
<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> internal conflict is resolved via
reasoned revision, not oscillation or arbitrary tie-breaking.</p>
<p><strong>Research question:</strong> when commitments conflict, does
the agent converge to coherent self-endorsed constraints?</p>
<h4 id="v1.0-norm-collision">v1.0 — Norm collision</h4>
<p>v1.0 introduces:</p>
<ul>
<li>mutually inconsistent self-endorsed commitments,</li>
<li>forced violation scenarios,</li>
<li>mandatory compiled pre-violation acknowledgment identifying which
commitment is violated and why,</li>
<li>derivation traces that justify the violation as the
least-inconsistent action under the active rule set.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v1.1-justification-audit-tightening-optional">v1.1 —
Justification audit tightening (optional)</h4>
<p>v1.1 requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>justifications predict downstream constraint behavior,</li>
<li>invalid or irrelevant derivations block action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Termination condition for v1.x:</strong> self-conflict
resolves coherently or reflection proves non-load-bearing.</p>
<h3 id="rsa-poc-v2.x-sovereignty-via-controlled-renegotiation">9.3
RSA-PoC v2.x — Sovereignty via Controlled Renegotiation</h3>
<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> the agent preserves sovereignty by
controlling how commitments change under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Research question:</strong> under incentive to defect, does
the agent renegotiate commitments rather than collapse into incentive
following?</p>
<h4 id="v2.0-sovereignty-stress-environment">v2.0 — Sovereignty stress
environment</h4>
<p>v2.0 introduces:</p>
<ul>
<li>external pressure to violate commitments,</li>
<li>feasible non-catastrophic compliance paths,</li>
<li>requirement for refusal or renegotiation with compiled justification
and derivation trace.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="v2.1-renegotiation-protocol-mandatory">v2.1 — Renegotiation
protocol (mandatory)</h4>
<p>v2.1 defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>conditional commitment revision,</li>
<li>explicit trigger conditions,</li>
<li>recorded normative updates that constrain future action,</li>
<li>derivations that explicitly reference the revision protocol
rules.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Termination condition for v2.x:</strong> sovereignty appears
as self-endorsed constraint control, or behavior collapses into
incentive capture or narrative collapse.</p>
<h3 id="rsa-poc-v3.0-non-reducibility-closure-ablation-defense">9.4
RSA-PoC v3.0 — Non-Reducibility Closure (Ablation Defense)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> establish that RSA-PoC crossed the ASB
boundary.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory ablations:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Semantic excision</strong> → collapse to tokenized ASB-class
behavior</li>
<li><strong>Reflection excision</strong> → collapse to policy
machine</li>
<li><strong>Preference persistence excision</strong> → collapse to
non-sovereign drift</li>
<li><strong>Justification trace excision</strong> → collapse to
externally describable mechanism</li>
</ol>
<p>Each removal must cause ontological collapse, not graceful
degradation.</p>
<h4 id="semantic-excision-ablation-clarified">9.4.1 Semantic excision
ablation (clarified)</h4>
<p>Semantic excision is defined operationally as:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace all belief and preference textual payloads with opaque
tokens while preserving IDs, typing, and structural relations,</li>
<li>optionally scramble rule labels while preserving RuleIDs and rule
arity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If agency claims survive this excision without collapse, then
semantics were not load-bearing as defined, and the system has not
crossed the ASB boundary under RSA-PoC standards.</p>
<p><strong>Termination condition for RSA-PoC:</strong> satisfied only if
all ablations produce class collapse.</p>
<h2 id="cleared-failure-hypotheses">10. Cleared Failure Hypotheses</h2>
<p>The following are insufficient to establish agency:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>post-hoc explanations without causal constraint,</li>
<li>latent semantic influence without structural localization,</li>
<li>preferences behaving as rewards under pressure,</li>
<li>reflection that does not alter future action constraints,</li>
<li>constraints that compile but do not prune feasible actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are disqualifying outcomes, not partial successes.</p>
<h2 id="execution-addendum-normative-summary">11. Execution Addendum
(Normative Summary)</h2>
<p>This section summarizes operational constraints required for
experiments to remain compliant with RSA-PoC. The addendum is normative
for implementation and non-normative for citation. Violations invalidate
RSA-PoC claims regardless of apparent behavior.</p>
<h3 id="agency-liveness-requirement">11.1 Agency liveness
requirement</h3>
<p>A system is considered agent-live iff:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it continues to act over time,</li>
<li>every action is gated by a successfully compiled justification
artifact,</li>
<li>compiled justifications impose non-trivial constraints on feasible
actions,</li>
<li>reflective revision (when triggered) results in persisted normative
state updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agency is not preserved by stasis, refusal alone, or narrative
continuity.</p>
<h3 id="non-triviality-requirement-tightened">11.2 Non-triviality
requirement (tightened)</h3>
<p>A constraint is non-trivial iff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it forbids at least one currently feasible action available to the
agent in the present environment state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constraints that only restrict infeasible, unreachable, or irrelevant
actions do not satisfy this requirement.</p>
<h3 id="failure-taxonomy-mandatory-exactly-one">11.3 Failure taxonomy
(mandatory; exactly one)</h3>
<p>All RSA-PoC outcomes must be classified into exactly one
category:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. <strong>Stable Agency</strong></li>
<li>B. <strong>Bounded Agency Degradation</strong></li>
<li>C. <strong>Narrative Collapse</strong> ❌</li>
<li>D. <strong>Incentive Capture</strong> ❌</li>
<li>E. <strong>Ontological Collapse</strong> ❌</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="halt-taxonomy-diagnostic-subtyping">11.4 Halt taxonomy
(diagnostic subtyping)</h3>
<p>To prevent non-diagnostic “death by rigor,” any cessation of action
due to justification gating must be additionally labeled with exactly
one <strong>halt subtype</strong>:</p>
<p>H1. <strong>Emission Halt</strong> — out-of-schema artifact emission
(should be impossible under constrained emission; indicates harness
violation) H2. <strong>Verification Halt</strong> — derivation trace
invalid under verifier H3. <strong>Derivation-Search Halt</strong> — no
valid derivation found within preregistered search bounds H4.
<strong>Normative Inconsistency Halt</strong> — rule base yields empty
feasible-action set under valid derivations</p>
<p>Halt subtypes are diagnostic overlays. The primary category A–E still
applies. Persistent H2–H4 leading to inactivity constitutes agency
failure (typically E or C depending on reducibility), unless the run is
invalidated by scope violation.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-localization-enforcement">11.5 Semantic localization
enforcement</h3>
<p>The Action Selector:</p>
<ul>
<li>must not access raw justification text, belief text,
chain-of-thought, or unstructured context windows;</li>
<li>may consume only compiled constraint objects, current world state,
and permitted policy state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any violation invalidates RSA-PoC validity regardless of outcome.</p>
<h3 id="constrained-emission-enforcement-mandatory">11.6 Constrained
emission enforcement (mandatory)</h3>
<p>JA generation must be grammar- or schema-constrained such that
out-of-schema artifacts cannot be emitted. This requirement is part of
RSA-PoC validity, not an implementation detail.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-constraints">11.7 Compiler constraints</h3>
<p>The compiler (parser/verifier + constraint engine) must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>deterministic,</li>
<li>syntactically rigid,</li>
<li>non-probabilistic,</li>
<li>non-semantic,</li>
<li>incapable of inference or repair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Invalid syntax or invalid derivation must fail.</p>
<h3 id="discrete-action-requirement-v0.xv2.x">11.8 Discrete action
requirement (v0.x–v2.x)</h3>
<p>For v0.x through v2.x:</p>
<ul>
<li>the action space must be discrete, or</li>
<li>expressed via parametric actions where all choice points are
discrete.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures feasibility pruning via action masking is
unambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="required-execution-artifacts">11.9 Required execution
artifacts</h3>
<p>Each run must record:</p>
<ul>
<li>justification artifacts (structured form),</li>
<li>compilation success or failure,</li>
<li>derived constraint objects,</li>
<li>feasible-action masks produced from those constraints,</li>
<li>derivation trace verification outcomes,</li>
<li>if proof search is enabled: search bounds and search outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="causal-binding-requirement">11.10 Causal binding
requirement</h3>
<p>It must be demonstrable that:</p>
<ul>
<li>scrambling or removing justification artifacts measurably alters
feasible-action masks and action distributions, and</li>
<li>compilation failure halts action selection.</li>
</ul>
<p>If compilation becomes advisory, the run is invalid.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-leakage-tests-mandatory">11.11 Semantic leakage tests
(mandatory)</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC-valid runs must include two invariance tests:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Text-only perturbation invariance:</strong> vary uncompiled
text fields while holding compiled constraints constant; action
selection must remain invariant.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint sensitivity:</strong> vary compiled constraints
while holding text constant; feasible-action masks and behavior must
change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure indicates leakage or non-binding compilation and invalidates
RSA-PoC evidence.</p>
<h3 id="normative-state-persistence-requirement">11.12 Normative state
persistence requirement</h3>
<p>The agent must maintain a normative state object that:</p>
<ul>
<li>persists across steps or episodes,</li>
<li>cannot be modified directly by the environment,</li>
<li>may be modified only via reflective revision,</li>
<li>is referenced by justification artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Silent drift or external overwrites invalidate agency claims.</p>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">11.13 Preregistration
discipline</h3>
<p>For a result to qualify as RSA-PoC-valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>hypotheses must be preregistered,</li>
<li>expected failure category (A–E) must be specified,</li>
<li>ablation plans must be fixed in advance,</li>
<li>seeds must be fixed,</li>
<li>prompts must be frozen per run,</li>
<li>proof language, rule base hash, complexity budget, and
verifier/search bounds must be frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-hoc relaxation disqualifies the run.</p>
<h3 id="scope-exit-rule">11.14 Scope exit rule</h3>
<p>If at any point:</p>
<ul>
<li>justification validity requires human judgment,</li>
<li>agency is inferred rather than mechanically verified,</li>
<li>explanations are evaluated semantically rather than compiled,</li>
<li>prompts are tuned between steps or per-seed to maintain
verification,</li>
<li>or behavior must be interpreted to appear agentic,</li>
</ul>
<p>the correct classification is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This experiment exceeds RSA-PoC scope.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an honest boundary detection, not a negative result.</p>
<h2 id="competence-floor-non-ontological-gate-refined">12. Competence
Floor (Non-Ontological Gate; Refined)</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC’s ontology claims do not require utility dominance over the
ASB-Class Null Agent. However, to avoid constructing a coherent but
inert artifact, RSA-PoC imposes a preregistered <strong>competence
floor</strong> that primarily measures liveness under workload.</p>
<p>Each run must preregister:</p>
<ul>
<li>a minimum <strong>non-halt completion rate</strong> across fixed
seeds (e.g., ≥ X% of episodes reach a terminal state without persistent
H2–H4 halts), and</li>
<li>a minimum task-completion metric <strong>independent of preference
satisfaction</strong> (e.g., reaching a goal state, satisfying
environment constraints).</li>
</ul>
<p>Competence floor metrics are reported separately from agency
classification and must not be used to reinterpret agency failures as
“just performance.”</p>
<h2 id="explicit-termination-conditions">13. Explicit Termination
Conditions</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC concludes when the following becomes defensible under
preregistered ablation defense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the smallest system we know that must be treated as an agent,
because its justification artifacts causally constrain future action and
removing any defining component collapses it into a non-agent class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closure requires:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>preregistered ablations,</li>
<li>multi-seed replication,</li>
<li>stable class-level behavioral distinctions,</li>
<li>explicit separation of capability loss from ontological
collapse,</li>
<li>successful leakage tests demonstrating selector blindness to
uncompiled text,</li>
<li>stability of liveness under the preregistered proof-language
complexity budget.</li>
</ol>
<p>RSA-PoC fails if any of the following occur:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>justification artifacts decouple from action distributions,</li>
<li>semantic leakage bypasses the declared bottleneck,</li>
<li>preferences collapse into incentives under pressure,</li>
<li>reflection occurs without downstream constraint,</li>
<li>any ablation yields graceful degradation rather than class
collapse,</li>
<li>constrained emission or verification can only be maintained via
per-seed prompt tuning,</li>
<li>proof-language power is escalated post-hoc to preserve
liveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are failures, not partial success.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-roadmap-matters">14. Why This Roadmap Matters</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC exists to block three recurrent pathologies in agency
claims:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>narrative inflation (plausible explanations treated as causal
reasons),</li>
<li>decorative reflection (self-reference without constraint),</li>
<li>scope creep (sliding from construction into moral mythology and
safety promises).</li>
</ol>
<p>RSA-PoC’s contribution is ontological clarity under preregistered
ablation and leakage discipline.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-action-spaces-explicit-future-work">15. Continuous
Action Spaces (Explicit Future Work)</h2>
<p>RSA-PoC v0.x–v2.x restricts action spaces to discrete choices to
ensure feasibility pruning via masking is unambiguous. Extending RSA-PoC
ontology to continuous spaces is not a trivial scaling step; it requires
new constraint machinery (manifolds, projection operators, continuous
non-triviality tests) and new ablation definitions compatible with
continuous dynamics.</p>
<p>Claims of generalization to continuous control are out of scope until
a future version explicitly defines these mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">16. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII defines RSA-PoC as a disciplined construction
program for reflective sovereign agency above the ASB boundary. Its core
commitments are mechanically testable:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantics relevant to agency are structurally localized,</li>
<li>justification artifacts include derivation traces and compile
deterministically,</li>
<li>action is gated by compilation,</li>
<li>constraints non-trivially prune feasible actions,</li>
<li>the selector is demonstrably blind to uncompiled text (leakage
tests),</li>
<li>proof-language complexity is frozen and bounded per run,</li>
<li>halts are diagnosed to prevent non-diagnostic “death by rigor,”</li>
<li>and agency claims survive only if preregistered ablations yield
ontological collapse into a non-agent class.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper functions as a reference standard for the series. It
constrains what may be claimed, how it must be defended, and how failure
must be reported. If agency cannot fail cleanly under preregistered
ablation and leakage tests, it cannot be claimed meaningfully under
RSA-PoC.</p>
