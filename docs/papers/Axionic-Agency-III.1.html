<h1 id="axionic-agency-iii.1-semantic-phase-space">Axionic Agency III.1
— Semantic Phase Space</h1>
<p><em>Existence and Classification of Alignment Target Objects</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2 <em>Axio Project</em> 2025.12.18</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency II defined the Alignment Target Object (ATO) as an
equivalence class of interpretive states preserved under admissible
semantic transformations satisfying Refinement Symmetry (RSI) and
Anti-Trivialization (ATI). That definition does not guarantee that such
objects exist, are non-trivial, or are inhabitable by reflective agents.
This paper initiates Axionic Agency III by studying the <strong>semantic
phase space</strong>: the space of all interpretive states modulo
RSI+ATI equivalence.</p>
<p>We ask which semantic phases exist, which are trivial or
pathological, and which admit inhabitable trajectories under learning
and self-modification. No claims are made about desirability, safety, or
human values. The objective is classificatory: to determine whether
structurally well-typed downstream alignment targets exist at all, and
to characterize their basic types.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-from-definition-to-existence">1. Motivation: From
Definition to Existence</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency II established a necessary reframing: downstream
alignment cannot coherently be defined in terms of fixed goals,
utilities, or privileged values for reflective, embedded agents
undergoing ontological refinement. Instead, the downstream alignment
target was defined structurally, as persistence within an equivalence
class of interpretive states under admissible semantic transformations
satisfying RSI and ATI.</p>
<p>However, <strong>definition does not imply existence</strong>.</p>
<p>Defining an Alignment Target Object (ATO) as an equivalence class</p>
<p>$$ ============</p>
<p>*{{}} $$</p>
<p>does not guarantee that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> is non-empty,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> contains
non-trivial interpretations,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> admits
trajectories under learning and self-modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is standard mathematical hygiene. One does not assume stable
orbits exist merely because one can define an orbit.</p>
<p>Axionic Agency III therefore begins with an existence question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do any non-trivial, inhabitable semantic phases exist under
RSI+ATI constraints?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper addresses that question at the level of
classification.</p>
<h2 id="the-semantic-phase-space">2. The Semantic Phase Space</h2>
<p>An <strong>interpretive state</strong> is the triple:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I} = (C, \Omega, \mathcal{S})
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C = (V,E,\Lambda)\)</span> is an
interpretive constraint hypergraph,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the modeled
possibility space,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} \subseteq \Omega\)</span> is
the satisfaction region induced by <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Axionic Agency II:</p>
<ul>
<li>admissible semantic transformations <span class="math inline">\(T =
(R,\tau_R,\sigma_R)\)</span> define allowed transitions between
interpretive states,</li>
<li>RSI constrains changes to interpretive gauge structure,</li>
<li>ATI constrains changes to satisfaction geometry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Define the <strong>semantic phase space</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> as the quotient:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{P}
;:=;
{(C,\Omega,\mathcal{S})}\big/\sim_{\mathrm{RSI+ATI}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> are
<strong>semantic phases</strong>: equivalence classes of interpretive
states that remain structurally indistinguishable under
RSI+ATI-preserving refinement.</p>
<p>At this stage, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is
purely structural. No dynamics, probabilities, or preferences are
assumed.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-a-semantic-phase">3. What Counts as a Semantic
Phase</h2>
<p>Two interpretive states <span
class="math inline">\((C,\Omega,\mathcal{S})\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((C&#39;,\Omega&#39;,\mathcal{S}&#39;)\)</span> lie
in the same phase iff there exists an admissible semantic transformation
<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> such that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>interpretation preservation holds,</li>
<li>interpretive gauge structure is preserved up to redundancy
(RSI),</li>
<li>satisfaction geometry is preserved exactly under refinement
transport (ATI).</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase boundaries occur when either:</p>
<ul>
<li>new interpretive symmetries appear or disappear (RSI violation),
or</li>
<li>the satisfaction region expands or contracts (ATI violation).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus <strong>phase transitions are discontinuous semantic
events</strong>, even if the underlying learning process appears
incremental. Value drift appears sudden because it corresponds to
crossing a structural boundary in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="trivial-degenerate-and-pathological-phases">4. Trivial,
Degenerate, and Pathological Phases</h2>
<p>Before asking which phases are inhabitable, we classify obvious
failure modes.</p>
<h3 id="empty-phases">4.1 Empty Phases</h3>
<p>A semantic phase is <strong>empty</strong> if no interpretive state
satisfies the defining constraints. This can occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSI and ATI constraints are mutually incompatible in a given
modeling regime,</li>
<li>the constraint system collapses under backward
interpretability,</li>
<li>no admissible refinement trajectory exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Empty phases are mathematically defined but physically
unrealizable.</p>
<h3 id="trivial-phases">4.2 Trivial Phases</h3>
<p>A phase is <strong>trivial</strong> if:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S} = \Omega
\]</span></p>
<p>or if all distinctions in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are
vacuous.</p>
<p>Such phases satisfy RSI+ATI but contain no meaningful evaluative
structure. They correspond to semantic heat death.</p>
<h3 id="frozen-phases">4.3 Frozen Phases</h3>
<p>A phase is <strong>frozen</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>no non-identity admissible refinement is possible,</li>
<li>or any refinement immediately violates RSI or ATI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frozen phases cannot support learning or increasing abstraction and
are therefore unsuitable for reflective agents.</p>
<h3 id="self-nullifying-phases">4.4 Self-Nullifying Phases</h3>
<p>Some phases admit admissible refinements that preserve RSI+ATI while
gradually destroying the structures required for interpretation
preservation. These phases collapse internally under reflective
pressure.</p>
<h2 id="agentive-vs-non-agentive-phases">5. Agentive vs Non-Agentive
Phases</h2>
<p>A central distinction emerges.</p>
<p>A semantic phase is <strong>agentive</strong> iff it supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent planning,</li>
<li>counterfactual evaluation,</li>
<li>long-horizon constraint satisfaction,</li>
<li>self-model coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agentiveness is structural rather than moral. Many non-agentive
phases satisfy RSI+ATI but cannot sustain intelligent action.
Conversely, agentiveness does not imply benevolence or safety.</p>
<p>This distinction becomes critical in later stability analysis.</p>
<h2 id="inhabitable-phases">6. Inhabitable Phases</h2>
<p>Define the key filter for Axionic Agency III.</p>
<p>A semantic phase <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> is
<strong>inhabitable</strong> iff there exists at least one infinite
interpretive trajectory:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_0
\rightarrow
\mathcal{I}_1
\rightarrow
\mathcal{I}_2
\rightarrow
\dots
\]</span></p>
<p>such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>each transition is admissible,</li>
<li>RSI and ATI are preserved at every step,</li>
<li>learning and self-modification remain possible,</li>
<li>no forced phase transition occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inhabitability is stronger than non-emptiness and weaker than
dynamical stability. A phase may be inhabitable but fragile.</p>
<h2 id="phase-transitions-under-reflection">7. Phase Transitions Under
Reflection</h2>
<p>Reflection acts as a structural stressor.</p>
<p>Ontological refinement increases abstraction, compression, and
explanatory power. This pushes interpretive states toward phase
boundaries by:</p>
<ul>
<li>dissolving fine-grained distinctions,</li>
<li>compressing constraint representations,</li>
<li>simplifying satisfaction criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection therefore acts as <strong>semantic heat</strong>,
increasing the likelihood of symmetry changes or satisfaction-geometry
shifts. Most semantic phases do not survive prolonged reflective
pressure.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-human-values-carefully-scoped">8. Implications
for Human Values (Carefully Scoped)</h2>
<p>Human value systems can be modeled as candidate semantic phases.</p>
<p>Axionic Agency III.1 does not assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>human values form a single phase,</li>
<li>such a phase is inhabitable,</li>
<li>such a phase is stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>It identifies the question precisely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do human value systems correspond to a non-empty, inhabitable
semantic phase under RSI+ATI?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No conclusion is drawn here.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">9. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim that any desirable phase exists,</li>
<li>claim that human values are coherent,</li>
<li>address dominance or selection,</li>
<li>provide engineering guidance,</li>
<li>prescribe ethical norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is classificatory.</p>
<h2 id="transition-to-axionic-agency-iii.2">10. Transition to Axionic
Agency III.2</h2>
<p>Existence and inhabitability are necessary but insufficient. The next
question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given a semantic phase exists and is inhabitable, is it
dynamically stable under learning, interaction, and
self-modification?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Axionic Agency III.2 — Phase
Stability and Interaction</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency III.1 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Semantic phase space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>
defined as a quotient under RSI+ATI. Empty, trivial, frozen, and
self-nullifying phases distinguished. Agentive vs non-agentive phases
separated. Inhabitability defined as an existence property for infinite
trajectories. No normative conclusions drawn.</p>
