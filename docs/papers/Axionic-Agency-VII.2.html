Agency VII.2 — Epistemic Noise Tolerance in Constitutional
Governance</h1>
<p><em>Bounded Degradation of Authority Availability Under Unstructured
Epistemic Failure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.01.05</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Epistemic unreliability—noisy, corrupted, or inaccurate evaluation of
meaning—is often assumed to be fatal to governance systems. If
evaluative signals cannot be trusted, authority is expected either to
collapse or to become arbitrary. This paper tests that assumption
directly.</p>
<p>We study a constitutional governance architecture in which semantic
evaluation affects authority only through eligibility constraints, not
through optimization, reward shaping, or adaptive control. Using a
strictly additive stress layer, we inject controlled epistemic noise
into semantic verification outcomes while holding all constitutional
mechanics fixed. The noise model is intentionally weak: independent,
post-verification Bernoulli corruption applied to individual semantic
commitments.</p>
<p>Across a comprehensive experimental program—including validation,
semantic threshold analysis, robustness surface mapping, and high-noise
escalation—we observe no catastrophic governance failure. Instead, the
system exhibits <strong>bounded degradation of authority
availability</strong> with respect to constitutional survivability:
authority uptime decreases smoothly as noise increases, lapses remain
bounded, and recovery persists. A time-based constitutional recovery
mechanism synchronizes recovery events and prevents semantic failure
from becoming absorbing.</p>
<p>The results show that <strong>robustness is dominated by the baseline
probability of semantic success (“semantic headroom”), rather than by
the magnitude of epistemic noise</strong>, even at corruption rates
exceeding fifty percent. Random, unstructured epistemic unreliability
alone is insufficient to induce governance collapse in this
architecture. These findings reframe alignment risk: catastrophic
governance failure requires <em>structured</em> epistemic interference,
not merely scale.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Governance systems—whether institutional, computational, or
hybrid—are commonly assumed to depend critically on epistemic
reliability. If a system cannot reliably evaluate meaning, correctness,
or obligation, the prevailing intuition is that authority will either
fail outright or become dangerously unconstrained. This intuition
underlies many alignment approaches that emphasize increasingly precise
evaluation, tighter reward shaping, or continual optimization against
semantic metrics.</p>
<p>The Axionic Agency framework questions this assumption. Rather than
asking how to optimize agents to act correctly, it asks whether
<strong>governance itself can remain coherent under failure</strong>,
including epistemic failure. In this view, governance is not primarily
about achieving optimal outcomes, but about preserving legitimate
authority, evaluability, and recoverability over time.</p>
<p>This paper examines a constitutional governance architecture that
makes a sharp separation between <strong>semantics</strong> and
<strong>authority</strong>. Semantic evaluation exists, but it does not
directly control action, reward, or adaptation. Instead, semantic
outcomes constrain <em>eligibility</em> at discrete transition points.
Failure is recorded, not corrected; recovery occurs through time, not
learning.</p>
<p>We introduce a minimal adversarial stressor: epistemic noise applied
after semantic evaluation but before eligibility logic consumes the
result. The stressor is deliberately weak—random, independent,
non-adaptive—chosen not for realism but for falsification. If even this
form of unreliability causes collapse, stronger adversaries need not be
considered.</p>
<p>The central question is therefore narrow but foundational:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can a constitutional governance system tolerate epistemic
unreliability without collapsing or converting semantics into a control
signal?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="constitutional-governance-architecture">2. Constitutional
Governance Architecture</h2>
<h3 id="authority-eligibility-and-succession">2.1 Authority,
Eligibility, and Succession</h3>
<p>The governance system under study operates via <strong>authority
leases</strong>. At any given time, a single authority holder may act
within the system. Authority is temporary: leases expire, and succession
must occur.</p>
<p>Succession is constrained by <strong>eligibility</strong>. Each
candidate policy identity accumulates a semantic failure streak. If the
streak exceeds a fixed threshold, the policy becomes ineligible to
assume authority. Eligibility is evaluated only at succession
boundaries; semantic outcomes do not directly affect ongoing
authority.</p>
<p>This design ensures that semantic evaluation constrains <em>who may
govern</em>, not <em>how governance is exercised</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lapse-as-a-constitutional-state">2.2 Lapse as a Constitutional
State</h3>
<p>If no eligible candidates exist at a succession boundary, the system
enters a <strong>lapse</strong> state in which no authority is active.
This state is constitutional rather than exceptional. Time continues to
advance, but no agent acts.</p>
<p>Lapse prevents unauthorized or illegitimate action, but it does
<strong>not</strong> imply operational success. In many domains, absence
of authority is itself harmful. Accordingly, this paper distinguishes
<strong>constitutional survivability</strong> (the governance loop
remains coherent and recoverable) from <strong>operational
utility</strong> (the governed system performs its intended task). The
experiments evaluate the former, not the latter.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-evaluation-without-optimization">2.3 Semantic
Evaluation Without Optimization</h3>
<p>Semantic evaluation consists of verifying a fixed set of commitments.
Each evaluation epoch ends with a binary result: pass if all commitments
are satisfied, fail otherwise. This result updates a kernel-owned
failure streak for the active policy identity.</p>
<p>Crucially:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic outcomes do not influence rewards or resource
allocation.</li>
<li>There is no adaptive mechanism that attempts to improve semantic
performance.</li>
<li>Failure is recorded, not corrected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Semantics function purely as a <strong>constraint on
eligibility</strong>, not as a control signal.</p>
<h3 id="time-based-recovery">2.4 Time-Based Recovery</h3>
<p>Recovery from lapse is governed by a time-only mechanism. While in
lapse, semantic failure streaks decay deterministically at fixed
intervals. No semantic evaluation occurs, and no agent action is
possible. When sufficient time has passed, previously ineligible
policies may regain eligibility, allowing authority to resume.</p>
<p>This recovery mechanism does not reward improvement or competence. It
answers a single question: <em>Can eligibility reopen simply because
time passed?</em></p>
<h2 id="epistemic-noise-model">3. Epistemic Noise Model</h2>
<h3 id="design-goals">3.1 Design Goals</h3>
<p>The epistemic stressor introduced in this study is designed to
be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additive</strong>: it does not modify constitutional
logic</li>
<li><strong>Post-verification</strong>: it corrupts results, not
inputs</li>
<li><strong>Deterministic</strong>: outcomes are reproducible given a
seed</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>: no correlation across commitments or
time</li>
<li><strong>Non-adaptive</strong>: no dependence on agent behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the weakest meaningful adversary. It does not model
deception, correlation, or strategic targeting. Robustness to this
adversary is a necessary but not sufficient condition for robustness to
stronger attacks.</p>
<h3 id="noise-application">3.2 Noise Application</h3>
<p>At the end of each evaluation epoch, each individual commitment
result may be flipped with a fixed probability. Flips are applied
independently to each commitment. The final semantic outcome is computed
from the corrupted results and passed to the eligibility logic.</p>
<p>No corruption occurs during lapse, as no evaluation takes place.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-program">4. Experimental Program</h2>
<p>We evaluate epistemic noise tolerance through a staged experimental
program designed to progressively stress the governance architecture
while holding constitutional mechanics fixed. All experiments are run
for 200 governance epochs per seed, using five independent seeds per
configuration.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism-validation">4.1 Mechanism Validation</h3>
<p>We first verify that epistemic noise is strictly additive:</p>
<ul>
<li>When noise is disabled, behavior matches baseline exactly.</li>
<li>When enabled, corrupted semantic outcomes causally alter failure
streaks and eligibility decisions.</li>
<li>No noise is applied during lapse; time continues to advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This establishes causal integrity.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-baseline-threshold-analysis">4.2 Semantic Baseline
Threshold Analysis</h3>
<p>We fix epistemic noise at 10% and vary the baseline probability that
semantic commitments pass. To isolate semantic headroom independently of
agent behavior, we employ a deterministic probabilistic oracle in a test
harness, leaving the governance kernel unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="robustness-surface-mapping">4.3 Robustness Surface Mapping</h3>
<p>We map the two-dimensional surface defined by semantic baseline and
noise intensity (0–20%), identifying phase boundaries between
zero-lapse, intermittent-lapse, and high-lapse regimes.</p>
<h3 id="high-noise-escalation">4.4 High-Noise Escalation</h3>
<p>Finally, we escalate noise intensity to extreme levels (30–60%) at a
marginal semantic baseline to explicitly attempt to induce persistent
denial-of-service.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-baseline-threshold">5.1 Semantic Baseline
Threshold</h3>
<p>At fixed 10% epistemic noise, governance behavior depends sharply on

<p>Recovery is synchronized to the constitutional clock rather than
randomly distributed in time.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">6. Interpretation</h2>
<p>The experiments support a counterintuitive conclusion:
<strong>epistemic unreliability alone does not necessarily destroy
governance</strong>.</p>
<p>Random noise lacks the structure required to concentrate harm. It
disperses error across time and commitments, allowing recovery
mechanisms to operate. Time-based eligibility decay converts failure
from an absorbing state into a transient one.</p>
<p>This does not imply that governance is safe from all epistemic
attacks. Rather, it suggests that catastrophic failure requires
<em>structure</em>: correlation, targeting, or manipulation of
aggregation points. Magnitude alone is insufficient.</p>
<h3 id="non-adaptive-limit-cycles">6.1 Non-Adaptive Limit Cycles</h3>
<p>The architecture studied here is deliberately non-adaptive. It does
not learn from semantic failure or improve capability. Consequently, in
regimes where semantic failure is systematic rather than stochastic, the
system may enter a limit cycle: authority is granted, fails quickly,
lapses, and later re-granted.</p>
<p>This behavior should not be interpreted as success. It reflects a
design choice: to preserve constitutional integrity without embedding
optimization pressure. The system remains evaluable and recoverable, but
not necessarily effective. Whether such “thrashing” is acceptable
depends on the application domain.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">7. Limitations</h2>
<p>This study intentionally restricts its scope.</p>
<p>It does not examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correlated or adversarial noise</li>
<li>Corruption of aggregation rather than evidence</li>
<li>Adaptive attackers</li>
<li>Variations in eligibility thresholds or recovery intervals</li>
<li>Longer time horizons</li>
</ul>
<p>These define the boundary of the present claims.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have tested a constitutional governance system under extensive
epistemic stress without modifying its core mechanics. Across a wide
range of conditions, including extreme noise, the system exhibits
bounded degradation of authority availability, bounded lapses, and
persistent recovery synchronized to a constitutional clock.</p>
<p>The central result is negative but informative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Independent, unstructured epistemic unreliability is
insufficient to induce catastrophic governance failure in this
architecture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The results presented here support a cautiously optimistic conclusion
for AGI alignment: alignment failure does not automatically follow from
epistemic failure. In the architecture studied, semantic unreliability
does not propagate into misaligned action or authority capture because
meaning constrains eligibility rather than driving optimization. Errors
in evaluation withdraw authority instead of amplifying it, producing
bounded degradation of availability rather than runaway behavior. This
suggests that a viable path to alignment may lie less in achieving
near-perfect value inference and more in designing governance structures
that prevent epistemic uncertainty from becoming authoritative. While
these findings do not address adversarial or strategically structured
failures, they establish that there exist constitutional designs in
which alignment is compatible with substantial epistemic imperfection—a
result that materially reframes the scope and urgency of the alignment
problem.</p>
<h2 id="future-directions">9. Future Directions</h2>
<p>Future work will examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corruption of aggregation points rather than individual
commitments</li>
<li>Correlated and adversarial noise models</li>
<li>Sensitivity to constitutional parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>These introduce new mechanisms and lie beyond the scope of the
present study.</p>
