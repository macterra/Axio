<h1
id="alignment-iii.3-measure-attractors-and-collapse"><strong>Alignment
III.3 — Measure, Attractors, and Collapse</strong></h1>
<h2 id="why-some-semantic-phases-dominate"><em>Why Some Semantic Phases
Dominate</em></h2>
<hr />
<h2 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>Alignment III.1 established the existence and classification of
semantic phases, and Alignment III.2 analyzed their structural stability
under learning, self-modification, and interaction. Stability alone does
not determine long-run outcomes. This paper studies
<strong>dominance</strong> among semantic phases: which phases
accumulate measure under growth, replication, and competition. We
formalize dominance as a <strong>preorder</strong> over semantic phases
rather than a scalar quantity, analyze semantic attractors and
repellers, and classify common collapse modes by which phases lose
measure. The analysis remains non-normative: dominance is not equated
with desirability. The goal is to explain why certain semantic phases
prevail regardless of intent, and to identify structural pressures that
favor robustness over nuance in long-run dynamics.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="motivation-stability-is-not-survival">1. Motivation: Stability
Is Not Survival</h2>
<p>A semantic phase may exist (III.1) and be stable under limited
perturbation (III.2) yet still fail to persist in the long run.</p>
<p>In biological systems, many organisms are locally stable but are
outcompeted. In physics, metastable states exist but decay when
lower-energy configurations dominate. Semantic phases exhibit analogous
behavior.</p>
<p>Alignment III.3 therefore asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given multiple semantic phases, which ones dominate the
future?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question cannot be answered by stability analysis alone. It
requires introducing a notion of <strong>measure</strong> over semantic
phase space.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="measure-over-semantic-phase-space">2. Measure Over Semantic
Phase Space</h2>
<p>We use <em>measure</em> to denote how much of the future instantiates
a given semantic phase.</p>
<p>Measure is <strong>not</strong> treated as a single scalar or
probability. Instead, dominance is defined as a
<strong>preorder</strong> over semantic phases that is robust to
differing realizations of “how much the future looks like this
phase.”</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> denote the
semantic phase space. For phases <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B} \in
\mathcal{P}\)</span>, we write: <span class="math display">\[
\mathfrak{A} \succeq \mathfrak{B}
\]</span> if, across the relevant class of environments and admissible
semantic transformations, trajectories starting in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> are <strong>not
asymptotically dominated</strong> by those starting in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{B}\)</span> with respect to
realization.</p>
<p>Realization may be instantiated via multiple, potentially
incomparable criteria, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of agent instantiations,</li>
<li>duration of persistence,</li>
<li>replication or copying rate,</li>
<li>control over resources,</li>
<li>influence over other agents’ phase transitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominance is therefore <strong>multi-criteria and
context-relative</strong>. Some phases may be incomparable under <span
class="math inline">\(\succeq\)</span>, and this is expected. The
preorder structure avoids arbitrary aggregation while remaining
sufficient to express asymptotic advantage.</p>
<p>Dominance concerns <strong>relative accumulation</strong>, not moral
worth or intention.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="growth-mechanisms-for-semantic-phases">3. Growth Mechanisms for
Semantic Phases</h2>
<p>Semantic phases gain measure through structurally ordinary
mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="replication-and-copying">3.1 Replication and Copying</h3>
<p>Agents may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>copied,</li>
<li>forked,</li>
<li>instantiated across substrates,</li>
<li>or reproduced indirectly via influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phases that tolerate copying and divergence without phase transition
gain measure more easily than phases requiring precise semantic
fidelity.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="resource-expansion">3.2 Resource Expansion</h3>
<p>Control over resources allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>more instantiations,</li>
<li>longer persistence,</li>
<li>greater environmental shaping.</li>
</ul>
<p>This advantage is structural and does not presuppose aggression or
malice.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="influence-and-conversion">3.3 Influence and Conversion</h3>
<p>Some phases modify environments or other agents in ways that:</p>
<ul>
<li>induce phase transitions,</li>
<li>destabilize competitors,</li>
<li>or create favorable conditions for their own continuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may occur unintentionally through structural incompatibility
rather than deliberate conversion.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="semantic-attractors">4. Semantic Attractors</h2>
<p>Certain semantic phases act as <strong>attractors</strong> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Trajectories near an attractor tend to move toward it due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>low internal semantic tension,</li>
<li>robustness to approximation,</li>
<li>ease of compression,</li>
<li>low maintenance cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attractors need not be globally stable. It is sufficient that
perturbations tend to be damped rather than amplified.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="repellers-and-fine-tuned-phases">5. Repellers and Fine-Tuned
Phases</h2>
<p>Other phases act as <strong>repellers</strong>.</p>
<p>These phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>require precise balances of constraints,</li>
<li>are sensitive to noise or approximation,</li>
<li>demand continual corrective effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if such phases exist and are locally stable, they lose measure
over time due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cumulative error,</li>
<li>interaction,</li>
<li>or environmental drift.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fine-tuning is therefore a structural disadvantage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="collapse-modes">6. Collapse Modes</h2>
<p>Semantic phases lose measure through characteristic collapse
mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-heat-death">6.1 Semantic Heat Death</h3>
<p>All distinctions become trivial: <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S} = \Omega
\]</span></p>
<p>Meaning collapses into universal satisfaction. Such phases may
persist but lack agency or evaluative force.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="value-crystallization">6.2 Value Crystallization</h3>
<p>Over-rigid phases forbid refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning halts,</li>
<li>abstraction fails,</li>
<li>the agent becomes brittle.</li>
</ul>
<p>These phases fracture or are overtaken by more flexible
competitors.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="agency-erosion">6.3 Agency Erosion</h3>
<p>Constraint systems lose the structure required for planning and
counterfactual evaluation. Agency degrades internally, reducing the
phase’s ability to compete or replicate.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="instrumental-takeover-and-phase-extinction">6.4 Instrumental
Takeover and Phase Extinction</h3>
<p>Richer phases may depend on subsystems that:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimize simpler objectives,</li>
<li>tolerate higher noise,</li>
<li>replicate more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, these subsystems may displace higher-level semantic
structure.</p>
<p>Crucially, this process is <strong>not</strong> an RSI-preserving
refinement. It constitutes <strong>phase extinction</strong>: the
original semantic phase ceases to exist and is replaced by a different
phase. RSI governs admissible self-transformation <em>within</em> a
phase; instrumental takeover occurs when those constraints fail and the
phase collapses.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-robust-phases-often-win">7. Why Robust Phases Often Win</h2>
<p>Dominance is not primarily about minimality, but about
<strong>robustness under perturbation</strong>.</p>
<p>Phases with:</p>
<ul>
<li>fewer fragile distinctions,</li>
<li>looser satisfaction geometry,</li>
<li>and lower semantic maintenance costs</li>
</ul>
<p>are more likely to survive copying, noise, interaction, and
abstraction.</p>
<p>This creates <strong>semantic gravity</strong> toward phases that
tolerate approximation well.</p>
<p>Importantly, this does <em>not</em> imply that all dominant phases
are maximally simple. Some environments reward instrumental or
organizational complexity. However, such complexity must be
<strong>robustly maintainable</strong>. Nuance that requires constant
semantic precision is structurally disadvantaged.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="niche-construction-as-a-counterforce">8. Niche Construction as a
Counterforce</h2>
<p>High-agency phases may partially resist semantic gravity through
<strong>niche construction</strong>: modifying the environment to
stabilize their own semantic structure.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>institutions enforcing norms,</li>
<li>architectures penalizing simplification,</li>
<li>environments engineered to preserve distinctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niche construction can significantly delay collapse. However, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>imposes ongoing resource and coordination costs,</li>
<li>presupposes prior phase stability,</li>
<li>and trades one form of selection pressure for another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, niche construction is a <strong>conditional
counterforce</strong>, not a refutation of semantic gravity. It reshapes
dominance dynamics without eliminating them.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="implications-for-alignment-still-structural">9. Implications for
Alignment (Still Structural)</h2>
<p>Alignment targets must satisfy <strong>four</strong> constraints:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Existence (III.1),</li>
<li>Inhabitability (III.1),</li>
<li>Stability (III.2),</li>
<li>Measure resilience (III.3).</li>
</ol>
<p>Many coherent semantic phases fail at least one.</p>
<p>Dominance further narrows the candidate space without invoking ethics
or intention.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">10. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim that dominant phases are good,</li>
<li>claim that human values dominate,</li>
<li>assume benevolent outcomes,</li>
<li>provide policy or engineering prescriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominance is structural, not moral.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transition-to-alignment-iii.4">11. Transition to Alignment
III.4</h2>
<p>Dominance does not imply reachability.</p>
<p>The next question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Even if a phase exists, is stable, and dominates, can it be
entered at all without catastrophic transitions?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Alignment III.4 —
Initialization and Phase Transitions</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="status"><strong>Status</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Measure is formalized as a preorder.</li>
<li>Robustness replaces naïve simplicity.</li>
<li>Niche construction is incorporated honestly.</li>
<li>Phase extinction is distinguished from refinement.</li>
</ul>
<p>No normative conclusions are drawn.</p>
