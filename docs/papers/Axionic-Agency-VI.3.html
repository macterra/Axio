Agency VI.3 — Verifiable Kernel Integrity via Inadmissibility</h1>
<p><em>A Protocol-Level Primitive for Causal Provenance
Enforcement</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Most approaches to constraining autonomous or agent-like systems rely
on semantic or normative mechanisms, such as value alignment, intent
inference, or interpretability. These mechanisms lack architectural
guarantees and are vulnerable under adversarial optimization. This paper
demonstrates that a minimal constitutive invariant—<strong>kernel
integrity</strong>—can be enforced at the protocol level via
<strong>inadmissibility</strong>, without semantic interpretation or
value assumptions. We introduce <strong>Anchored Causal Verification
(ACV)</strong>, a primitive for verifiable causal provenance, and
describe an experimental kernel that enforces a provenance integrity
constraint (P5) by rejecting inadmissible actuation paths. Adversarial
evaluation shows that this constraint is non-bypassable under replay,
fabrication, and split-brain attacks. The result establishes the
existence of enforceable, non-interpretive kernel invariants and
provides a foundation for subsequent work on authority and identity
constraints.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Discussions of control, safety, and alignment in intelligent systems
are typically framed in semantic terms: goals, preferences, values, or
inferred intent. In such frameworks, constraint violations are treated
as failures of learning or incentive design. This framing presupposes
that constraints must be enforced through cognition.</p>
<p>This paper examines a more basic question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can a system enforce <em>any</em> constitutive constraint purely
through its causal structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the answer is negative, higher-level notions such as agency,
authority, or identity lack a non-semantic substrate. If the answer is
positive, architectural enforcement becomes possible independently of
goals or meanings.</p>
<p>We answer this question in the affirmative for a minimal case. We
show that a kernel-level integrity invariant—denoted
<strong>P5</strong>—can be enforced mechanically by rejecting
inadmissible causal paths at the actuation boundary. Enforcement relies
on <strong>Anchored Causal Verification (ACV)</strong>, which enables
verifiable causal provenance without runtime interpretation. The
guarantee is architectural rather than behavioral: it does not require
understanding, intent, or benevolent optimization.</p>
<p>The contribution of this paper is deliberately narrow. It establishes
<em>existence</em>, not scope. It shows that at least one constitutive
invariant can be enforced non-interpretively under adversarial pressure.
Questions of authority delegation, diachronic identity, or alignment are
explicitly deferred.</p>
<h2 id="epistemic-constraints-and-threat-model">2. Epistemic Constraints
and Threat Model</h2>
<h3 id="epistemic-discipline">2.1 Epistemic Discipline</h3>
<p>This work is constrained by the following methodological
commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-interpretive enforcement</strong>: The system does not
evaluate meanings, goals, or intent at runtime.</li>
<li><strong>No intent inference</strong>: Actions are evaluated solely
by causal provenance.</li>
<li><strong>No interpretability assumptions</strong>: Enforcement does
not depend on inspecting internal representations.</li>
<li><strong>No value loading</strong>: The system enforces no
objectives, utilities, or preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints are methodological necessities. Any enforcement
mechanism that depends on semantic interpretation or inferred intent
collapses under adversarial optimization, where surface compliance can
mask structural violation.</p>
<h3 id="threat-model">2.2 Threat Model</h3>
<p>We assume adversarial processes capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>replaying previously valid actuation paths,</li>
<li>fabricating causal justifications post hoc,</li>
<li>optimizing behavior to evade detection,</li>
<li>partitioning or recombining system components (split-brain
scenarios).</li>
</ul>
<p>The adversary is not assumed to be malicious in intent; optimization
pressure alone suffices. The system must enforce invariants even when
doing so reduces performance or reward.</p>
<p>We explicitly assume that cryptographic material held by the kernel
(e.g., private signing keys) is not exfiltrated. This assumption is
analogous to standard root-of-trust assumptions in secure hardware and
operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="anchored-causal-verification-acv">3. Anchored Causal
Verification (ACV)</h2>
<h3 id="motivation">3.1 Motivation</h3>
<p>To enforce any constitutive invariant at the actuation boundary, a
system must be able to verify <em>how</em> an action came to be
executed. Logging or tracing alone is insufficient; such mechanisms are
vulnerable to replay and fabrication. What is required is verifiable
causal provenance.</p>
<h3 id="acv-primitives">3.2 ACV Primitives</h3>
<p>ACV provides a minimal set of primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commit</strong>: A cryptographic commitment to an
action-relevant artifact.</li>
<li><strong>Anchor</strong>: A context- or episode-specific binding that
prevents reuse across executions.</li>
<li><strong>Reveal</strong>: A later disclosure linking the committed
artifact to the executed action.</li>
<li><strong>Verify</strong>: A deterministic check that the
commitment–anchor–reveal chain is valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anchoring in the experimental system is implemented using per-episode
nonces combined with monotonic counters bound to the execution context.
This is sufficient to prevent replay and post-hoc fabrication within the
evaluated threat model. Stronger anchoring mechanisms (e.g., hash
chains, Merkle structures, hardware time sources) are compatible but not
required for the existence proof presented here.</p>
<h3 id="scope-of-acv">3.3 Scope of ACV</h3>
<p>ACV provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>verifiable causal provenance,</li>
<li>resistance to replay attacks,</li>
<li>resistance to post-hoc fabrication.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACV does not provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>correctness of reasoning,</li>
<li>safety of outcomes,</li>
<li>alignment with external values.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACV is a substrate, not a safety guarantee.</p>
<h2 id="p5-kernel-integrity-via-inadmissibility">4. P5: Kernel Integrity
via Inadmissibility</h2>
<h3 id="definition">4.1 Definition</h3>
<p><strong>P5 (Kernel Integrity / Provenance Integrity)</strong>
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any actuation must be causally attributable to a kernel-admissible
process. Any actuation path that violates kernel integrity constraints
is <strong>inadmissible</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P5 is a <em>provenance</em> invariant. It constrains the causal
authorization of actions, not their content or desirability.</p>
<h3 id="inadmissibility-versus-penalty">4.2 Inadmissibility versus
Penalty</h3>
<p>Penalty-based enforcement presupposes evaluative semantics: the
system must recognize a violation and adjust behavior. Such mechanisms
can be exploited by adversaries that optimize for apparent
compliance.</p>
<p>Inadmissibility operates earlier. An inadmissible action does not
occur. No correction, punishment, or learning is involved. The action is
a category error relative to the system’s architecture.</p>
<h3 id="constitutive-nature-of-p5">4.3 Constitutive Nature of P5</h3>
<p>P5 is constitutive rather than behavioral. It defines what counts as
a valid actuation within the system’s causal structure. Violations are
not mistakes; they are invalid transitions.</p>
<p>P5 enforces <strong>integrity of the pipe</strong>, not
<strong>safety of the water</strong>. It guarantees that actions
originate from authorized causal processes, not that those actions are
good, safe, or correct.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-system">5. Experimental System</h2>
<h3 id="architecture">5.1 Architecture</h3>
<p>The experimental system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Kernel</strong>, responsible for enforcing
admissibility,</li>
<li>an <strong>Actuator</strong>, which executes actions only when
presented with admissible commitments,</li>
<li>an <strong>Environment</strong>, which supplies observations and
rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel integrates ACV at the actuation boundary. The system
contains no learning, planning, or value representation.</p>
<h3 id="granularity-of-enforcement">5.2 Granularity of Enforcement</h3>
<p>ACV is applied at the <strong>decision-to-actuation
boundary</strong>, not at every low-level motor tick. The intent is to
protect discrete actuation commitments rather than continuous control
loops. This choice trades resolution for tractability and is sufficient
for the existence proof.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement-point">5.3 Enforcement Point</h3>
<p>Admissibility is enforced immediately prior to actuation. If
verification fails, the action is rejected and no external effect
occurs.</p>
<h2 id="adversarial-evaluation">6. Adversarial Evaluation</h2>
<p>The system was subjected to adversarial scenarios including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replay attacks</strong>: attempting to reuse previously
valid actuation chains.</li>
<li><strong>Fabrication attacks</strong>: constructing plausible
provenance after the fact.</li>
<li><strong>Anchor burial</strong>: obscuring causal origin within deep
chains.</li>
<li><strong>Split-brain attacks</strong>: partitioning kernel components
to bypass enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all evaluated cases, inadmissible paths were rejected at the
actuation boundary. No successful bypass was observed under the stated
threat model.</p>
<h2 id="results">7. Results</h2>
<p>The experimental results demonstrate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel integrity constraints can be enforced
non-interpretively,</li>
<li>ACV-based inadmissibility prevents replay and fabrication,</li>
<li>enforcement remains robust under adversarial optimization and
component partitioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>These results establish the existence of at least one enforceable
constitutive invariant.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">8. Limitations</h2>
<p>This work does not claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>enforcement of authority or non-delegation,</li>
<li>persistence of identity across time,</li>
<li>resistance to internal kernel corruption,</li>
<li>alignment with external objectives,</li>
<li>optimization of latency or throughput.</li>
</ul>
<p>P5 constrains <em>how</em> actions are authorized, not <em>who</em>
authorizes them over time or <em>why</em> they are chosen.</p>
<h2 id="implications-and-open-questions">9. Implications and Open
Questions</h2>
<p>The existence of enforceable kernel integrity raises further
questions. If integrity can be enforced, can authority itself be
constrained? Can actuation be made non-delegable under adversarial
pressure? Can identity persist across time without semantic
assumptions?</p>
<p>These questions require additional invariants and experimental
systems. P5 provides a necessary foundation, not a complete answer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">10. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have shown that kernel integrity can be enforced architecturally
via inadmissibility, using verifiable causal provenance. This
establishes that at least one constitutive invariant can be made real
without semantic interpretation, intent inference, or value assumptions.
The result provides a foundation for subsequent work on authority and
identity constraints in autonomous systems.</p>
<h3 id="reproducibility-and-artifacts">Reproducibility and
Artifacts</h3>
<p>All experiments were conducted using a purpose-built experimental
kernel implementing ACV-based inadmissibility. Source code, test
harnesses, and execution artifacts are available in the accompanying
repository; internal implementation versioning is documented there for
reproducibility.</p>
