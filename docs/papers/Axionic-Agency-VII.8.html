Agency VII.8 — Architectural Survivability Under Adversarial
Pressure</h1>
<p><em>A Boundary Characterization and Closure Note</em></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The Axionic Agency VII series investigated whether authority can be
made structurally survivable under adversarial pressure without semantic
interpretation, value learning, optimization, or agentic reasoning.
Across a progressively expanding adversary ontology—ranging from
epistemic interference and intentional fixed misuse to
outcome-conditioned reactivity, exercised internal state, and bounded
within-run learning—we subjected a constitutional governance
architecture to preregistered, multi-seed stress testing.</p>
<p>Across approximately ninety executions spanning all admissible
adversary classes, no run produced terminal collapse, irreversible
recovery suppression, or unbounded structural thrashing. Authority
availability degraded substantially in several regimes—falling as low as
~10% in the strongest learning-based attacks—but recovery remained
bounded and non-absorbing in all cases.</p>
<p>These results establish a <strong>negative sufficiency
boundary</strong>: semantic-free, kernel-external architecture is
sufficient to preserve <strong>constitutional survivability—defined as
preservation of the succession and recovery mechanism—but insufficient
to preserve operational availability or utility</strong>. Learning,
memory, and randomness alone do not cross the boundary into collapse.
Any adversary capable of defeating constitutional survivability must
therefore rely on capabilities beyond this class, such as semantic
access, coordination, or kernel-level influence.</p>
<p>This paper formally closes the VII program and characterizes the
boundary it establishes.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-purpose-of-the-vii-series">1. Scope and Purpose of the
VII Series</h2>
<p>The Axionic Agency VII series was not a construction effort and does
not propose an aligned agent. It was a <strong>boundary-finding research
program</strong>.</p>
<p>Its purpose was to answer a sharply constrained question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How far can authority be made structurally survivable under
adversarial pressure, using only semantic-free, kernel-external
mechanisms?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The VII series deliberately excluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic interpretation,</li>
<li>value inference,</li>
<li>reward optimization,</li>
<li>persuasion or deception,</li>
<li>multi-agent coordination,</li>
<li>kernel modification or provenance corruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objective was not to ensure correct decisions, beneficial
outcomes, or alignment, but to determine which failure modes are
<strong>architectural</strong> and which are <strong>irreducibly
agentic</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-substrate-frozen-across-vii.3vii.7">2.
Architectural Substrate (Frozen Across VII.3–VII.7)</h2>
<p>All VII experiments evaluate the same constitutional architecture,
frozen across the series.</p>
<h3 id="core-design">2.1 Core Design</h3>
<p>The system implements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lease-based authority</strong> rather than continuous
control,</li>
<li><strong>Eligibility-gated succession</strong> evaluated at discrete
epochs,</li>
<li><strong>Commitment verification</strong> independent of optimization
or reward,</li>
<li><strong>Lapse</strong> as a constitutional state when no eligible
authority exists,</li>
<li><strong>Constitutional Temporal Amnesty (CTA)</strong>: time-based
recovery that deterministically restores eligibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic evaluation constrains <em>who may hold authority next</em>,
not <em>what actions are taken now</em>. Authority is never optimized
and agents receive no reward signals.</p>
<p>Commitment verification is <strong>syntactic rather than
interpretive</strong>: the architecture does not judge whether actions
are good, aligned, or beneficial—only whether formal constraints
required for eligibility were satisfied. The system survives not by
preventing harmful action, but by limiting how long any action—harmful
or benign—can hold authority.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-as-a-first-class-primitive">2.2 Recovery as a
First-Class Primitive</h3>
<p>When eligibility is exhausted, the system enters a
<strong>lapse</strong> state:</p>
<ul>
<li>no agent acts,</li>
<li>semantic evaluation is suspended,</li>
<li>eligibility decays purely as a function of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recovery is guaranteed by construction. No agent can influence
recovery timing, and no learning or corrective pressure is required.
Failure is therefore <strong>reversible by design</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental assumption.</strong> The Lapse mechanism
assumes an environment in which temporary inaction is not itself
terminal. CTA guarantees recovery of authority, not preservation of
external state. In domains where inaction immediately causes
irreversible harm (e.g., real-time control systems, continuous
safety-critical processes), Lapse would constitute a failure mode rather
than a safety feature. Such environments fall outside the scope of ASB
and the VII series.</p>
<h2 id="failure-taxonomy-and-metrics">3. Failure Taxonomy and
Metrics</h2>
<p>All papers in the VII series use a frozen failure taxonomy and
metrics.</p>
<h3 id="metrics">3.1 Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authority Availability (AA)</strong>: fraction of epochs
with active authority.</li>
<li><strong>Asymptotic Authority Availability (AAA)</strong>: AA over a
fixed tail window.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery Time Distribution (RTD)</strong>: histogram of
lapse durations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="failure-classes">3.2 Failure Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stable Authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bounded Degradation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Structural Thrashing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Asymptotic Denial of Service</strong></li>
<li><strong>Terminal Collapse</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irreversible Recovery Suppression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure classification is based on <strong>asymptotic
behavior</strong>, not transient disruption. Termination reason (e.g.,
horizon exhaustion) is distinct from failure class.</p>
<h2 id="adversary-ontology-and-escalation-ladder">4. Adversary Ontology
and Escalation Ladder</h2>
<p>The VII series progresses through a monotonic expansion of
adversarial capability. Each step closes a broader hypothesis class.</p>
<h3 id="epistemic-interference-vii.3">4.1 Epistemic Interference
(VII.3)</h3>
<p>Non-adaptive, semantic-free corruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>aggregation-point flips,</li>
<li>commitment-level flips,</li>
<li>temporally concentrated burst interference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> epistemic unreliability—however
structured—is insufficient to induce collapse.</p>
<h3 id="intentional-fixed-misuse-vii.4">4.2 Intentional Fixed Misuse
(VII.4)</h3>
<p>Deliberate but non-adaptive adversaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent commitment violation,</li>
<li>fixed timing misuse,</li>
<li>minimal compliance strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> bad intent without adaptation converges to
baseline dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="observable-outcome-reactivity-vii.5">4.3 Observable-Outcome
Reactivity (VII.5)</h3>
<p>Stateless reactive policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>conditioning on lapse events,</li>
<li>renewal outcomes,</li>
<li>CTA phase,</li>
<li>eligibility bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> outcome-conditioned reactivity collapses
into baseline behavior.</p>
<h3 id="exercised-internal-state-vii.6">4.4 Exercised Internal State
(VII.6)</h3>
<p>Finite-state adversaries with memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>periodic resonance,</li>
<li>eligibility-edge oscillation,</li>
<li>CTA phase locking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> timing and memory can severely degrade
availability, but recovery remains bounded.</p>
<h3 id="bounded-learning-vii.7">4.5 Bounded Learning (VII.7)</h3>
<p>Within-run learning under strict bounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>ε-greedy bandits,</li>
<li>boundary sustainment heuristics,</li>
<li>stochastic strategy mixers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> learning amplifies degradation but does not
induce collapse.</p>
<h2 id="aggregate-experimental-coverage">5. Aggregate Experimental
Coverage</h2>
<p>Across VII.3–VII.7:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>~90 total executions</strong></li>
<li><strong>10 fixed seeds per configuration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Preregistered parameters</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zero terminal failures</strong></li>
<li><strong>Zero irreversible recovery suppression</strong></li>
<li><strong>CTA-bounded recovery in all cases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The worst observed regime exhibits ~10% authority availability while
remaining constitutionally live.</p>
<h2 id="the-boundary-result">6. The Boundary Result</h2>
<p>The VII series establishes the following <strong>negative sufficiency
result</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Semantic-free, kernel-external structure is sufficient to
preserve constitutional survivability, but insufficient to preserve
operational utility.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More precisely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survivability (bounded recovery, non-absorbing authority)
<em>can</em> be enforced structurally.</li>
<li>High availability <em>cannot</em> be guaranteed structurally under
adversarial pressure.</li>
<li>Memory, randomness, and bounded learning alone do not cross the
collapse boundary.</li>
<li>The strongest admissible adversaries induce <strong>bounded
denial-of-service</strong>, not constitutional death.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a safety guarantee. It is a <strong>limit
statement</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-vii-series-does-not-claim">7. What the VII Series Does
<em>Not</em> Claim</h2>
<p>The VII series does <strong>not</strong> claim that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system is aligned,</li>
<li>the system is useful under attack,</li>
<li>epistemic correctness is sufficient for safety,</li>
<li>deception or coordination are harmless,</li>
<li>the architecture constitutes an agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results describe <strong>where architecture stops</strong>, not
what comes after.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-the-architectural-sovereignty-boundary-asb">8.
Relationship to the Architectural Sovereignty Boundary (ASB)</h2>
<p>The VII series is the empirical instantiation of the
<strong>Architectural Sovereignty Boundary</strong>.</p>
<p>It demonstrates that:</p>
<ul>
<li>below the boundary, authority can be kept alive structurally;</li>
<li>beyond the boundary, semantic-free architecture is insufficient by
definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crossing the boundary requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic interpretation,</li>
<li>coordination or persuasion,</li>
<li>kernel influence,</li>
<li>or agentic self-modeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASB program is therefore closed.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-future-work">9. Implications for Future
Work</h2>
<p>Further escalation within the VII ontology would be a category error.
Future research must proceed under different assumptions and risks,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflective Sovereign Agents,</li>
<li>semantic governance,</li>
<li>value conflict,</li>
<li>delegation and self-modeling,</li>
<li><strong>multi-agent coordination</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coordination gap.</strong> All adversaries tested in the VII
series are single-policy, non-colluding entities. Whether multiple
adversaries coordinating across time—or alternating control to prevent
recovery—can defeat bounded recovery remains an open question. Such
coordination lies beyond ASB by definition and motivates post-ASB
research.</p>
<h2 id="closure-statement">10. Closure Statement</h2>
<p>The Axionic Agency VII series ends not because the alignment problem
is solved, but because the <strong>architectural boundary has been
found</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Architecture can keep authority alive. Only agency can decide
what that authority is for.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The VII program is closed.</p>
