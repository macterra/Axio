Agency V.3 — The Incoherence of Utopia Under Agent-Relative Value</h1>
<p><em>Teleological Closure, Value Drift, and the Structural Limits of
Political Design</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper argues that <em>utopia</em>, understood as a final and
authoritative social or world design, is structurally incoherent once
value is treated as agent-relative rather than objective. The
incoherence does not arise from moral disagreement, political fragility,
or implementation difficulty, but from the non-composability of
heterogeneous value functions under conditions of agency and value
drift. We show that any purported utopia must either freeze valuation,
suppress divergence, or authorize standing asymmetries to preserve
stability. Each strategy degrades the conditions that make agency
well-defined. The analysis reframes classic objections to
utopianism—including Le Guin’s Omelas thought experiment—not as moral
dilemmas but as structural diagnostics. We conclude by replacing utopia
with a plurality-preserving meta-architecture: a framework that enforces
constitutive constraints necessary for agency while maximizing
non-coerced future differentiation. The argument is situated relative to
Arrow-style impossibility results, Berlinian value pluralism, and
Nozick’s meta-utopia, updated through explicit agent-theoretic and
systems-engineering terminology.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>“Utopia” is typically presented as an ideal society or a perfected
world. This framing hides a stronger assumption: that there exists a
final arrangement that can be justified as <em>the</em> correct
destination, rather than as one contingent equilibrium among many.</p>
<p>This paper rejects that assumption.</p>
<p>The core claim is not that utopia is difficult to realize,
historically dangerous, or politically naïve. The claim is more
fundamental:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Utopia is ill-typed under agent-relative value.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once value is modeled as internal to agents rather than as a property
of world-states, the notion of a final, globally authoritative
arrangement loses coherence. The failure is not one of persuasion or
coordination. It is a structural failure in the space of admissible
designs.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries-and-definitions">2. Preliminaries and
Definitions</h2>
<h3 id="agents">2.1 Agents</h3>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> is a system capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>modeling counterfactual futures,</li>
<li>evaluating those futures under internal criteria,</li>
<li>and acting so as to influence realized outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>No assumption of perfect rationality, consistency, or optimality is
required. The definition is intentionally minimal.</p>
<h3 id="value-functions">2.2 Value Functions</h3>
<p>Each agent <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is associated
with a value function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U_i : W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> denotes the space of
possible world-histories.</p>
<p>Typing constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is agent-internal.</li>
<li>Cardinal scaling has no cross-agent meaning by default.</li>
<li>Interpersonal aggregation is undefined absent extra structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are representational constraints, not moral axioms.</p>
<h3 id="strong-utopia-maximal-satisfaction">2.3 Strong Utopia (Maximal
Satisfaction)</h3>
<p>A <strong>strong utopia</strong> is a world-state <span
class="math inline">\(w^* \in W\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall i,; w^* \in \arg\max U_i
\]</span></p>
<p>This definition captures the maximal satisfaction reading: the world
is optimal for every agent simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="weak-utopia-normative-finality">2.4 Weak Utopia (Normative
Finality)</h3>
<p>A <strong>weak utopia</strong> is any world-state <span
class="math inline">\(w^\dagger \in W\)</span> treated by a governance
structure as <em>normatively final</em>: a state that licenses
enforcement to stabilize itself against future divergence. Equivalently,
a weak utopia is a world-state for which the system asserts an authority
claim of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{“Further structural revision of } w^\dagger \text{ is
illegitimate.”}
\]</span></p>
<p>This definition captures the political meaning of utopia: the attempt
to close the space of future redesign.</p>
<h3 id="coercion-outcome-vs.-constitutive-constraints">2.5 Coercion:
Outcome vs. Constitutive Constraints</h3>
<p>We distinguish two forms of enforcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome coercion:</strong> enforcement that compels agents
toward substantive value-laden ends (specific ideals of the good
life).</li>
<li><strong>Constitutive constraints:</strong> enforcement that
maintains the conditions under which agency can exist at all (e.g.,
prohibitions on conquest, enslavement, or non-consensual
domination).</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction is structural rather than moral. It separates
enforcement that preserves the possibility of agency from enforcement
that substitutes an outcome for it.</p>
<h2 id="non-composability-of-world-optimality">3. Non-Composability of
World-Optimality</h2>
<h3 id="heterogeneous-value-functions">3.1 Heterogeneous Value
Functions</h3>
<p>Agents differ along dimensions that are not reducible to parameter
tuning:</p>
<ul>
<li>preference orderings,</li>
<li>risk tolerances,</li>
<li>identity commitments,</li>
<li>temporal discounting,</li>
<li>aesthetic standards,</li>
<li>moral side-constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>There exists no transformation <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U^*(w) = f(U_1(w), \dots, U_n(w))
\]</span></p>
<p>preserves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pareto improvements,</li>
<li>non-dictatorship,</li>
<li>non-arbitrariness,</li>
<li>and invariance under value revision.</li>
</ul>
<p>This result can be read as a systems-theoretic generalization of
Arrow-style impossibility theorems, paired with Berlinian value
pluralism, extended from social choice to world design under agency.</p>
<h3 id="consequence-for-strong-utopia">3.2 Consequence for Strong
Utopia</h3>
<p>Strong utopia fails as a coherent target unless one of the following
holds:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All agents share identical value functions.</li>
<li>Values are externally imposed.</li>
<li>Divergent agents are excluded, neutralized, or rewritten.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each condition contradicts the premise of agency in a multi-agent
world.</p>
<h2 id="value-drift-and-the-instability-of-final-arrangements">4. Value
Drift and the Instability of Final Arrangements</h2>
<p>Agents are not static preference tables. They are
<strong>value-generating processes</strong>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(U_i(t)\)</span> denote an agent’s
valuation at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For
non-degenerate agents,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dU_i}{dt} \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>A weak utopia therefore faces a drift problem: even if a world-state
aligns with agent valuations at <span class="math inline">\(t =
0\)</span>, it will lose alignment over time due to learning, aging,
cultural change, and endogenous preference evolution.</p>
<p>To remain utopian in the weak sense—normatively final—the system must
apply one of three stabilizers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Value freezing:</strong> preventing agents from revising
preferences or identities.</li>
<li><strong>Value policing:</strong> suppressing, correcting, or
pathologizing divergence.</li>
<li><strong>Exit suppression:</strong> preventing dissidents from
leaving or forming alternatives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each stabilizer functions as outcome coercion. Each degrades
agency.</p>
<p>The argument does not privilege novelty or flux. It requires only
that agents retain the capacity to revise <em>or reaffirm</em> their
values without external foreclosure.</p>
<h2 id="omelas-as-structural-diagnostic">5. Omelas as Structural
Diagnostic</h2>
<p>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas is often interpreted as a moral
tradeoff between happiness and suffering. That reading mislocates the
argument.</p>
<p>The child is not a dilemma. The child is evidence.</p>
<p>Its role is to reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li>standing asymmetry,</li>
<li>non-consensual dependency,</li>
<li>and irreversible authorization of harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The walkers do not reject happiness. They reject participation in a
system whose equilibrium depends on involuntary sacrifice.</p>
<p>Removing the child does not repair the structure. A closed system
that claims normative finality requires sinks for variance it cannot
admit. Sacrifice concentrates loss in a location where resistance is
structurally prevented.</p>
<p>Omelas is not a failed utopia. It is a diagnostic for the stabilizers
that closed designs require.</p>
<h2 id="the-closure-problem">6. The Closure Problem</h2>
<p>Weak utopia presupposes closure:</p>
<ul>
<li>completed convergence,</li>
<li>stable equilibrium,</li>
<li>and a resolved value landscape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agency presupposes openness:</p>
<ul>
<li>revision,</li>
<li>experimentation,</li>
<li>deviation,</li>
<li>and future differentiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A closed system cannot host open agents without contradiction. It
must either degrade agents or abandon finality.</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any world that remains utopian in the weak sense must
eventually cease to be agentic.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="plurality-preserving-meta-architectures">7. Plurality-Preserving
Meta-Architectures</h2>
<p>Rejecting utopia does not entail nihilism or dystopia. It changes the
design target.</p>
<p>The appropriate successor is a <strong>plurality-preserving
meta-architecture</strong>: a framework that enforces constitutive
constraints necessary for agency while leaving outcomes open.</p>
<p>Design objective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Maximize non-coerced future differentiation subject to
constitutive agency constraints.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not optimize a single ideal outcome,</li>
<li>does not require value convergence,</li>
<li>and treats exit, variance, and divergence as structural
features.</li>
</ul>
<p>This position resembles Nozick’s meta-utopia, though the
justification differs. Nozick derives plurality from rights and
side-constraints; the present argument derives it from non-composability
under value drift plus the necessity of preventing domination patterns
that erase agency.</p>
<h3 id="the-recursion-objection">7.1 The Recursion Objection</h3>
<p>A common objection asserts that enforcing non-coercion is itself
coercive, reintroducing a disguised utopia.</p>
<p>This objection collapses once coercion is typed.</p>
<p>Enforcing constitutive constraints does not impose a substantive
moral order. It enforces the preconditions under which agents can pursue
any order at all. A system that refuses such enforcement does not
preserve neutrality; it defaults to domination by the most coercive
agents.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-indeterminacy-and-political-contestation">7.2 Kernel
Indeterminacy and Political Contestation</h3>
<p>The distinction between constitutive constraints and outcome coercion
is structural, not algorithmic. No general decision procedure can
resolve all boundary cases—monopoly, redistribution, regulation—without
reintroducing substantive value commitments.</p>
<p>This indeterminacy is not a defect of the framework. It is an
unavoidable consequence of governing dynamic agents under uncertainty.
Disagreement over where constitutive enforcement ends and outcome
coercion begins is therefore a feature of political life, not a failure
of the architecture.</p>
<p>The framework constrains <em>what must be preserved</em> (agency)
without pretending to fully specify <em>how</em> every edge case must be
resolved.</p>
<h2 id="objections-and-replies">8. Objections and Replies</h2>
<h3
id="objection-utopia-requires-only-pareto-optimality-or-minimal-suffering.">Objection:
Utopia requires only Pareto-optimality or minimal suffering.</h3>
<p>Pareto-optimality and suffering minimization define constraint sets,
not unique optima. Treating any selected state as final reintroduces
weak-utopia closure. Constraint satisfaction is not optimization, and
optimization is not finality.</p>
<h3
id="objection-some-values-are-universal-so-aggregation-becomes-possible.">Objection:
Some values are universal, so aggregation becomes possible.</h3>
<p>Shared biological constraints limit admissible worlds. They do not
generate a total ordering over tradeoffs, distributions, or identities.
Universals support partial agreement, not normative finality.</p>
<h3 id="objection-overlapping-consensus-rescues-utopia.">Objection:
Overlapping consensus rescues utopia.</h3>
<p>Overlapping consensus enables local coordination and contingent
stability. Treating that stability as authoritative closure reintroduces
weak utopia.</p>
<h3 id="objection-natural-convergence-could-occur.">Objection: Natural
convergence could occur.</h3>
<p>Then utopia is unnecessary. Stability would arise without
enforcement. The argument concerns guaranteed convergence under drift,
not accidental harmony.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Utopia fails for structural reasons.</p>
<p>Value is agent-relative. Agency is dynamic. Optimization over
heterogeneous agents is non-composable. Finality requires stabilizers
that degrade agency.</p>
<p>The desire for utopia reflects a category error: treating worlds as
objects with intrinsic moral rank rather than treating agents as sources
of value whose trajectories diverge over time.</p>
<p>The relevant design question is no longer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What is the perfect world?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What kinds of frameworks can host agents while resisting
domination patterns that erase agency?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A plurality-preserving meta-architecture answers that question.
Utopia does not.</p>
