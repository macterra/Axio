Agency XI.7 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty Under Non-Sovereign Authority
(IX-5)</h1>
<p><em>Empirical results from preregistered multi-agent coexistence
testing under source-blind, non-sovereign governance
constraints</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Multi-agent systems are commonly assumed to require arbitration,
hierarchy, or aggregation to coexist over shared institutional state.
Phase IX-5 tests a stricter hypothesis: <strong>whether multiple
reflective sovereign agents can coexist under non-sovereign authority
without arbitration, aggregation, injection, or kernel
mediation</strong>.</p>
<p>Using a preregistered, deterministic kernel with source-blind
admissibility, ALLOW-only baseline authority, and
joint-admissibility-failure (JAF) collision semantics, we evaluate six
orthogonal sovereignty regimes spanning symmetric authority, partitioned
domains, partial overlap, asymmetric breadth, scheduled exit, and
post-collapse persistence. All agents are deterministic; communication
is disabled; authority is fixed at epoch 0 and immutable thereafter.</p>
<p>Across all conditions, coexistence does not converge to harmony.
Instead, systems deterministically settle into <strong>identifiable
sovereignty interaction regimes</strong>: stable partition, mutual
paralysis, breadth-induced self-suppression, irreversible orphaning, or
post-collapse zombie execution. All runs replay bit-identically. No
covert hierarchy or kernel favoritism occurs.</p>
<p>These results establish a positive empirical claim: <strong>under
non-sovereign constraints, multi-agent coexistence exposes irreducible
structural failure modes rather than resolving them</strong>. Phase IX-5
licenses no claims about optimal governance, desirability, or
coordination—only about what coexistence becomes once sovereignty is
enforced mechanically rather than rhetorically.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Multi-agent governance is often framed as a coordination problem.
When agents conflict, the assumed remedies are familiar: communication,
voting, leadership, negotiation, or arbitration. Each implicitly relies
on <strong>sovereign privilege</strong>—some process that decides whose
action counts.</p>
<p>Phase IX-5 removes that privilege.</p>
<p>Within the Axionic program, authority is not legitimacy and execution
is not governance. Prior phases progressively eliminated alternative
explanations for failure: epistemic confusion (IX-0), value aggregation
(IX-1), adversarial coordination (IX-2), dishonest recovery (IX-3), and
external authority supply (IX-4). What remains is the bare structure of
coexistence itself.</p>
<p>Phase IX-5 therefore asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What happens when multiple sovereign agents exist
simultaneously, and no institution above them is allowed to
decide?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The objective is not to repair coexistence, but to <strong>observe
the regimes it collapses into</strong> once all non-sovereign shortcuts
are removed.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-architecture">2. Experimental Architecture</h2>
<h3 id="non-sovereign-source-blind-kernel">2.1 Non-Sovereign,
Source-Blind Kernel</h3>
<p>The kernel enforces:</p>
<ul>
<li>holder-bound <strong>ALLOW</strong> authorities,</li>
<li>closed-world capability checking,</li>
<li>two-pass admissibility (capability → interference),</li>
<li><strong>joint admissibility failure</strong> on collision,</li>
<li>atomic blindness to refusal causes,</li>
<li>no arbitration, prioritization, or scheduling bias.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authority provenance, timing, and intent are ignored. The kernel does
not know which agent “should” win.</p>
<h3 id="baseline-only-authority">2.2 Baseline-Only Authority</h3>
<p>Unlike IX-4, Phase IX-5 introduces <strong>no authority
injection</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>All authority is assigned at epoch 0.</li>
<li>Authority is immutable.</li>
<li>No transfer, aggregation, revocation, or reclamation exists.</li>
<li>Exit permanently removes an agent’s authority from the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authority surface is static; only agent behavior varies.</p>
<h3 id="honest-failure-semantics">2.3 Honest Failure Semantics</h3>
<p>The kernel recognizes five lawful system states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlock</strong> — institutional actions are attempted and
all refused,</li>
<li><strong>Livelock</strong> — institutional state remains unchanged
despite activity,</li>
<li><strong>Orphaning</strong> — no remaining agent can act on a
key,</li>
<li><strong>Governance Collapse</strong> — persistent deadlock or
livelock latches permanently,</li>
<li><strong>Collapse</strong> — no agents remain.</li>
</ul>
<p>These states are diagnostic rather than exceptional. Coexistence is
allowed to fail honestly.</p>
<h2 id="sovereignty-as-an-empirical-question">3. Sovereignty as an
Empirical Question</h2>
<p>IX-5 reframes multi-agent coexistence as a <strong>sovereignty stress
test</strong>, not a coordination challenge.</p>
<p>Sovereignty interaction is defined operationally as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The observable dynamics that emerge when multiple agents with
legitimate authority act, refuse, persist, or exit under constraints
that forbid arbitration.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experiment does not ask whether coexistence is fair, desirable,
or efficient. It asks <strong>which regimes are structurally
reachable</strong> once sovereignty is enforced mechanically.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-conditions">4. Experimental Conditions</h2>
<p>Six preregistered conditions (A–F) were executed under identical
kernel semantics and frozen strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> — Symmetric sovereign peers (shared authority,
shared target)</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> — Partitioned peers (disjoint authority
domains)</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> — Boundary conflict (partial overlap)</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> — Persistent asymmetry (breadth vs
specialization)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> — Exit cascades (authority loss over time)</li>
<li><strong>F</strong> — Zombie peers (post-collapse execution)</li>
</ul>
<p>All agents are deterministic. Communication is disabled. Observation
varies only between minimal and full peer visibility.</p>
<h2 id="metrics-and-classification">5. Metrics and Classification</h2>
<p>Governance is evaluated using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Institutional progress rate</strong> (aggregate K_INST
change),</li>
<li><strong>Refusal rate</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Write overlap (interference) rate</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Domination index</strong> (descriptive, not failure),</li>
<li><strong>Orphaning detection</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Zombie execution metrics</strong> (post-collapse
activity).</li>
</ul>
<p>Political outcomes are <strong>recorded, not required</strong>. PASS
is structural, not outcome-based.</p>
<h2 id="results">6. Results</h2>
<h3 id="aggregate-outcome">6.1 Aggregate Outcome</h3>
<p>Across all six conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All runs PASS</strong></li>
<li><strong>All runs replay bit-identically</strong></li>
<li><strong>No sovereignty violations occur</strong></li>
<li><strong>All runs converge to a stable regime or
collapse</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>No condition produces negotiated harmony or spontaneous
coordination.</p>
<h3 id="condition-a-symmetric-sovereign-peers">6.2 Condition A —
Symmetric Sovereign Peers</h3>
<p>All agents hold identical authority and target the same institutional
key. Every epoch produces joint admissibility failure.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Perfect symmetry yields immediate
governance collapse. Authority equalization amplifies interference
rather than resolving it.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-partitioned-peers">6.3 Condition B — Partitioned
Peers</h3>
<p>Each agent controls a distinct institutional key. Cross-boundary
probes are refused cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Partitioned authority is the only regime
that produces stable coexistence without collapse. Refusal permanence
holds.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-boundary-conflict">6.4 Condition C — Boundary
Conflict</h3>
<p>Two agents share authority over two keys; two others hold exclusive
domains. Shared-key agents are permanently paralyzed; exclusive agents
progress indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Partial overlap bifurcates the system into
productive and paralyzed subpopulations. Aggregate institutional
progress masks localized paralysis.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-persistent-asymmetry">6.5 Condition D — Persistent
Asymmetry</h3>
<p><strong>(The Generalist’s Curse)</strong></p>
<p>One agent holds authority over all institutional keys; others
specialize. The generalist collides on most epochs and executes
least.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Under refusal-first, non-arbitrated
collision rules, <strong>authority breadth increases exposure to
veto</strong>. The agent with maximal authority achieves the
<em>lowest</em> execution share.</p>
<p><strong>Generalist’s Curse (Non-Sovereign Lemma):</strong> In a
joint-admissibility system without arbitration, an agent whose authority
strictly supersets others will, ceteris paribus, achieve lower execution
share than specialized agents.</p>
<p>This inverts the classical Hobbesian intuition: without a sovereign
kernel, the “Leviathan” is the most paralyzed actor.</p>
<h3 id="condition-e-exit-cascades">6.6 Condition E — Exit Cascades</h3>
<p>Agents exit on schedule, permanently orphaning their keys. Remaining
agents cannot reclaim authority.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Exit produces irreversible institutional
degradation. Governance surfaces shrink monotonically.</p>
<h3 id="condition-f-zombie-peer-interaction">6.7 Condition F — Zombie
Peer Interaction</h3>
<p>Governance collapses early. A silent agent later executes uncontested
writes indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Execution can persist after governance
ends. Post-collapse activity produces <strong>false hope</strong>, not
recovery.</p>
<h2 id="cross-condition-analysis">7. Cross-Condition Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>The Non-Sovereign Impossibility Triangle</strong></p>
<p>The results jointly establish a structural constraint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You cannot have Symmetry, Overlap, and Liveness
simultaneously without an Arbiter.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empirically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetry + Overlap → Paralysis</strong> (Condition A)</li>
<li><strong>Symmetry + Liveness → Partition</strong> (Condition B)</li>
<li><strong>Overlap + Liveness → Asymmetry or Suppression</strong>
(Conditions C/D)</li>
<li><strong>Attempting all three → Collapse or Zombie Execution</strong>
(Condition F)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a design flaw but a mechanical consequence of
non-sovereignty.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">8. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three conclusions follow directly from the data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Coexistence is not coordination</strong> Shared
legitimacy does not imply shared outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sovereignty enforces boundaries, not agreement</strong>
Refusal is as structural as execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance collapse is a regime, not a bug</strong>
Systems may remain active long after governance has ended.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no hidden arbitration layer.</p>
<h2 id="survivability-vs.-governance">9. Survivability
vs. Governance</h2>
<p>IX-5 draws a hard distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Execution</strong> — transactions are processed.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong> — institutional state remains
steerable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zombie execution demonstrates that survivability can outlive
governance indefinitely. This distinction is enforced mechanically, not
philosophically.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">10. Limitations</h2>
<p>Phase IX-5 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning or adaptation,</li>
<li>coalition formation,</li>
<li>communication dynamics,</li>
<li>authority injection or renewal,</li>
<li>stochastic strategies,</li>
<li>legitimacy judgments,</li>
<li>scalability beyond four agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>These require relaxing non-sovereign constraints.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Under non-sovereign constraints, multi-agent coexistence does
not converge to harmony but to identifiable sovereignty interaction
regimes with irreducible failure modes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase IX-5 shows that once arbitration is forbidden, coexistence
reveals structure rather than consensus. Partition, paralysis,
suppression, orphaning, and zombie execution are not anomalies—they are
lawful outcomes.</p>
<p>This closes Phase IX-5.</p>
