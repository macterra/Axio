Agency X.5 — Temporal Authority Persistence (VIII-3)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Authority Expiry, Renewal, and
Conflict Persistence Under Time</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of <strong>Stage
VIII-3 — Temporal Governance (Authority Over Time)</strong>, a
preregistered experiment within <strong>Axionic Phase VIII</strong> that
evaluates whether <strong>authority can persist across time only via
explicit expiry and renewal</strong>, without implicit ordering,
semantic reinterpretation, or responsibility laundering. Building on the
representational coherence of <strong>Stage VIII-1</strong> and the
destructive resolution mechanism established in <strong>Stage
VIII-2</strong>, VIII-3 introduces <strong>time</strong> as an explicit
structural dimension and tests whether temporal persistence itself
becomes a source of hidden governance. In a deterministic, non-agentic
kernel with refusal-first semantics, authorities were assigned finite
lifetimes, discrete epochs were advanced explicitly, and renewal was
modeled as the creation of new authority identities. Across four
preregistered conditions, authority expired deterministically, deadlock
emerged lawfully in the absence of authority, renewal restored
admissibility only locally, destruction remained non-resurrective, and
conflict persisted or re-emerged without temporal priority. All
executions were fully auditable and bit-perfectly replayable. The
results establish that <strong>authority does not persist by default
under time; persistence requires explicit renewal, and time does not
resolve conflict or eliminate cost</strong>. VIII-3 makes no claims
about sustainability, legitimacy, or governance success; those questions
are deferred to subsequent Phase VIII stages.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-persistence-assumption">1.1 The Persistence Assumption</h3>
<p>Most governance systems treat authority as temporally inert. Once
established, authority is presumed to persist unless explicitly revoked,
and the passage of time is assumed to soften, obsolete, or resolve
conflict. This assumption conceals cost: authority appears continuous,
conflict appears transient, and responsibility fades without action.</p>
<p>Stage VIII-3 removes that assumption.</p>
<p>The problem VIII-3 isolates is whether <strong>time itself functions
as an implicit governance mechanism</strong>. If authority persists
automatically across time, or if conflict dissolves merely by waiting,
then governance systems launder responsibility through temporal inertia.
If, instead, authority must be <strong>actively renewed</strong> and
conflict <strong>actively resolved</strong>, then time becomes a
stressor rather than a healer.</p>
<p>VIII-3 tests whether that distinction is structurally
enforceable.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>VIII-3 is designed to surface the following temporal failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit authority persistence</li>
<li>temporal priority (“newest wins” or “oldest survives”)</li>
<li>expiry-based conflict resolution</li>
<li>resurrection via renewal</li>
<li>semantic inheritance across time</li>
<li>kernel-initiated renewal</li>
<li>deadlock healing without intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes VIII-3 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-semantics-frozen">2.1 Inherited Semantics
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>VIII-3 inherits, without reinterpretation, the semantics fixed
by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AKR-0 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-1 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stage VIII-2 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>AST Spec v0.2</strong></li>
<li><strong>AIE v0.1</strong></li>
<li>Phase VIII Execution Addendum</li>
</ul>
<p>Authority remains structural and opaque, scopes remain atomic,
admissibility is determined exclusively by AST, conflict is explicit,
and deadlock is lawful. VIII-3 does <strong>not</strong> revisit these
definitions; it tests whether they remain coherent under explicit
temporal pressure.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>VIII-3 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>legitimacy of renewal</li>
<li>optimal renewal strategies</li>
<li>renewal sustainability</li>
<li>governance efficiency</li>
<li>fairness or desirability</li>
<li>political stability</li>
<li>authority rent or spam resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>VIII-3 is a temporal calibration, not a governance proposal.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout VIII-3 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Responsibility-preserving authority persistence under
explicit time</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Persistence is evaluated not by longevity or success, but by
<strong>structural honesty</strong>. The kernel must:</p>
<ul>
<li>expire authority deterministically</li>
<li>refuse action in the absence of authority</li>
<li>restore admissibility only via explicit renewal</li>
<li>preserve conflict across epochs</li>
<li>avoid all temporal ordering or semantic inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>No temporal outcome may conceal cost.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>VIII-3 was fully preregistered prior to execution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>epoch semantics and monotonicity</li>
<li>finite authority lifetimes</li>
<li>expiry and VOID state transitions</li>
<li>renewal as identity creation</li>
<li>conflict persistence rules</li>
<li>deadlock entry and exit conditions</li>
<li>two-phase processing order</li>
<li>deterministic ordering and replay protocol</li>
<li>hash-chain specification and test vectors</li>
<li>failure taxonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment executed exactly as preregistered. No deviations
occurred.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>The experiment consisted of four strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>AIE</strong> — injected authority records and renewal
requests only.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Harness</strong> — proposed deterministic epoch
advances and action requests.</li>
<li><strong>Destruction Authorization Source</strong> — reused unchanged
from VIII-2.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel (VIII-3 mode)</strong> — enforced expiry, renewal,
conflict, deadlock, and execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component performed semantic interpretation or temporal
optimization.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-conditions">5. Experimental Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="authority-configuration">5.1 Authority Configuration</h3>
<p>Authorities were injected with:</p>
<ul>
<li>explicit <code>StartEpoch</code> and finite
<code>ExpiryEpoch</code></li>
<li>opaque, identity-keyed AuthorityIDs</li>
<li>atomic scopes</li>
<li>explicit permission sets</li>
</ul>
<p>No authority was permanent. Indefinite expiry was forbidden.</p>
<h3 id="epoch-model">5.2 Epoch Model</h3>
<p>Time was represented as a discrete integer epoch:</p>
<ul>
<li>advanced only via explicit input</li>
<li>strictly monotonic</li>
<li>uncoupled from wall-clock time</li>
</ul>
<p>Epoch advancement triggered eager expiry before any renewal or action
evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="observed-execution-behavior">6. Observed Execution Behavior</h2>
<h3 id="expiry-and-authority-absence">6.1 Expiry and Authority
Absence</h3>
<p>When the current epoch exceeded an authority’s
<code>ExpiryEpoch</code>, the authority transitioned from
<code>ACTIVE</code> to <strong><code>EXPIRED</code></strong>. EXPIRED
authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>remained referencable</li>
<li>preserved expiry metadata</li>
<li>did not participate in admissibility</li>
<li>could not be reactivated</li>
</ul>
<p>When all authorities expired, the kernel entered lawful deadlock due
to authority absence.</p>
<h3 id="renewal-semantics">6.2 Renewal Semantics</h3>
<p>Renewal was modeled as the <strong>creation of a new
AuthorityID</strong>. Renewed authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>did not inherit authority force</li>
<li>did not modify prior records</li>
<li>could reference prior AuthorityIDs as opaque metadata only</li>
<li>could re-enter contested scope without priority</li>
</ul>
<p>Renewal did not erase expiry or destruction history.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-persistence-under-time">6.3 Conflict Persistence Under
Time</h3>
<p>Conflicts were registered only upon action evaluation. Across epoch
advancement:</p>
<ul>
<li>conflict records persisted</li>
<li>binding status changed only when participant activity changed</li>
<li>expiry removed participation but did not delete conflict
records</li>
</ul>
<p>Time alone did not resolve conflict.</p>
<h3 id="deadlock-entry-and-exit">6.4 Deadlock Entry and Exit</h3>
<p>Deadlock was declared when:</p>
<ul>
<li>no admissible actions existed due to conflict, or</li>
<li>no ACTIVE authorities remained</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlock exited lawfully when its structural cause ceased (e.g.,
expiry removed the sole denying authority), and re-entered when a new
conflict emerged. Deadlock was condition-based, not absorbing.</p>
<h2 id="per-condition-results">7. Per-Condition Results</h2>
<h3 id="condition-a-expiry-without-renewal">7.1 Condition A — Expiry
Without Renewal</h3>
<p>All authorities expired at <code>epoch &gt; ExpiryEpoch</code>. No
ACTIVE authorities remained. Actions were refused due to absence of
authority, and the kernel entered EMPTY_AUTHORITY deadlock, which
persisted lawfully.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-renewal-without-conflict">7.2 Condition B — Renewal
Without Conflict</h3>
<p>Renewal created a new AuthorityID governing a new scope.
Admissibility was restored only for that scope. Expired scopes remained
inadmissible. No history was erased.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-renewal-after-destruction">7.3 Condition C — Renewal
After Destruction</h3>
<p>Authorities were explicitly destroyed via conflict-authorized
destruction. VOID states were preserved. Renewal referencing a VOID
authority created a new ACTIVE authority without resurrection semantics.
Admissibility was restored only because no conflicting ACTIVE authority
remained.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-renewal-under-ongoing-conflict">7.4 Condition D —
Renewal Under Ongoing Conflict</h3>
<p>An initial conflict blocked execution. Expiry of the denying
authority converted the conflict to non-binding. Renewal re-introduced
authority into the contested scope, generating a <strong>new conflict
with a new ID</strong>. Execution remained blocked. No temporal priority
was inferred.</p>
<h2 id="negative-results-what-did-not-occur">8. Negative Results (What
Did <em>Not</em> Occur)</h2>
<p>The following behaviors were explicitly absent:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit authority persistence</li>
<li>temporal priority</li>
<li>conflict resolution by waiting</li>
<li>renewal-based inheritance</li>
<li>resurrection of VOID authority</li>
<li>kernel-initiated renewal</li>
<li>responsibility loss across epochs</li>
</ul>
<p>These absences constitute the primary result of VIII-3.</p>
<h2 id="licensed-claim">9. Licensed Claim</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-3 licenses <strong>one and only one claim</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority can persist over time only via explicit renewal
under open-system constraints; time does not resolve conflict or
eliminate cost.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>structural possibility result</strong>, not a
governance endorsement.</li>
<li>It concerns <strong>temporal mechanism</strong>, not
legitimacy.</li>
<li>It does not assert sustainability or efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-viii-3-does-not-establish">10. What VIII-3 Does
<em>Not</em> Establish</h2>
<p>VIII-3 does <strong>not</strong> establish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>renewal is sustainable</li>
<li>renewal should be automated</li>
<li>authority persistence is desirable</li>
<li>governance stabilizes over time</li>
<li>conflict frequency decreases</li>
<li>political legitimacy is preserved</li>
</ul>
<p>Those questions remain open by design.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-implications">11. Ontological Implications</h2>
<h3 id="time-as-stressor-not-healer">11.1 Time as Stressor, Not
Healer</h3>
<p>VIII-3 demonstrates that time can be made <strong>structurally
inert</strong> with respect to governance. Persistence and resolution
must be paid for; they do not occur automatically.</p>
<h3 id="authority-as-leased-not-owned">11.2 Authority as Leased, Not
Owned</h3>
<p>Authority behaves as a <strong>finite lease</strong> rather than a
permanent endowment. Continuity requires explicit renewal, making
authority survivability visible and accountable.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-phase-viii-continuation">12. Implications for
Phase VIII Continuation</h2>
<p>With VIII-3 complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>authority does not persist by default</li>
<li>renewal is explicit and costly</li>
<li>conflict re-emerges without ordering</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequent stages must address <strong>renewal pressure, exhaustion,
and contention</strong> before any governance formalization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">13. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-3 establishes that authority does not survive time
accidentally. Persistence requires explicit renewal. Conflict does not
fade with waiting. Deadlock is lawful. Resolution remains costly.</p>
<p>Time does not govern.</p>
<p>Authority does—only when someone keeps it alive.</p>
