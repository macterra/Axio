<h1 id="the-axionic-commitments">The Axionic Commitments</h1>
<p><em>Epistemic and Ontological Preconditions for Axionic
Agency</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.23</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document specifies the epistemic, ontological, and semantic
commitments presupposed by the Axionic Agency framework. These
commitments are not derived results and are not defended here; they
function as background conditions under which agency, authorship,
admissibility, and alignment-as-corollary are well-defined. The document
formalizes Conditionalism, semantic interpretation precedence,
Everettian quantum mechanics with objective probability identified as
branch measure, Bayesian credence as epistemic uncertainty, moral
subjectivism, and structural definitions of harm and coercion. All
results within Axionic Agency are explicitly conditional on these
commitments. Rejecting any commitment does not refute the framework but
places the rejecting position outside its domain of applicability. The
document serves as a typing discipline for the Axio Project, enabling
subsequent technical work to proceed without re-litigating metaphysical
or normative assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-and-scope">1. Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>This document enumerates the <strong>epistemic, ontological, and
semantic commitments</strong> presupposed by the Axionic Agency
framework.</p>
<p>These commitments are <strong>not conclusions</strong> derived from
Axionic Agency, nor are they defended or argued for here. They function
as <strong>background conditions</strong> under which the concepts of
agency, authorship, admissibility, and alignment-as-corollary are
well-defined.</p>
<p>All results derived within Axionic Agency are
<strong>conditional</strong> on these commitments. Rejecting any
commitment does not refute the framework; it places the rejecting
position <strong>outside its domain of applicability</strong>.</p>
<p>This document therefore serves as a <strong>typing
discipline</strong>, not a manifesto.</p>
<h2 id="epistemic-commitments">2. Epistemic Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="conditionalism">2.1 Conditionalism</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes <strong>Conditionalism</strong>: all truth
claims, evaluations, and interpretations are conditional on background
structure.</p>
<p>There are no unconditional truth claims within the framework.
Meaning, reference, and evaluation are always relative to an
interpretive context, whether explicit or implicit.</p>
<p>All statements within Axionic Agency are to be read as conditionals
of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Given background conditions X, claim Y holds.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unconditional assertions are therefore <strong>ill-typed within the
framework</strong>. This does not deny the existence of facts; it
specifies that all claims made here are conditional on explicit
background structure.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-interpretation-precedes-evaluation">2.2 Semantic
Interpretation Precedes Evaluation</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes that <strong>semantic interpretation is
logically prior to evaluation</strong>.</p>
<p>No evaluative claim—about value, harm, probability, or agency—can be
made without an interpretive frame that renders the relevant entities,
states, and transitions intelligible.</p>
<p>As a consequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluation without interpretation is undefined;</li>
<li>disagreements about value often reduce to disagreements about
interpretation;</li>
<li>agency-relative quantities presuppose interpretability of action,
state, and consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>This commitment grounds later distinctions between authored and
non-authored transitions.</p>
<h2 id="physical-commitments">3. Physical Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="everettian-quantum-mechanics">3.1 Everettian Quantum
Mechanics</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes <strong>unitary quantum mechanics without
collapse</strong>, commonly referred to as the Everettian or Many-Worlds
interpretation.</p>
<p>Quantum evolution is treated as deterministic at the level of the
universal wavefunction, with branching corresponding to decohered
outcomes.</p>
<p>No assumption is made that collapse occurs, nor that a single
privileged outcome is selected.</p>
<h3 id="objective-probability-as-measure">3.2 Objective Probability as
Measure</h3>
<p>Within this physical model, <strong>objective probability</strong> is
identified with <strong>branch measure</strong>.</p>
<p>Probability is not defined as long-run frequency, nor as subjective
belief. It is a physical quantity corresponding to the measure of
branches in which a given outcome occurs.</p>
<p>This quantity is referred to throughout the framework as
<strong>Measure</strong>.</p>
<p>Measure is objective, non-epistemic, and independent of any agent’s
beliefs.</p>
<h3 id="counterfactuals-as-physical-branches">3.3 Counterfactuals as
Physical Branches</h3>
<p>Within this framework, counterfactuals are not treated as abstract
modal constructs. Counterfactual evaluation refers to physically
realized alternative branches of the Everettian wavefunction that differ
with respect to the interpreted action or transition under
consideration. Counterfactual comparison is therefore grounded in
physical branch structure and objective measure, rather than in
stipulated possible-world semantics.</p>
<h2 id="probabilistic-commitments">4. Probabilistic Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="credence-as-epistemic-uncertainty">4.1 Credence as Epistemic
Uncertainty</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes a Bayesian interpretation of
<strong>credence</strong> as epistemic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Credence reflects an agent’s state of knowledge or ignorance about
which branch it occupies. It does not determine objective chance and
does not alter physical measure.</p>
<p>Measure and credence are distinct quantities with different
roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure is ontic and physical.</li>
<li>Credence is epistemic and agent-relative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflating the two is a category error within the framework.</p>
<h2 id="value-theoretic-commitments">5. Value-Theoretic Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="moral-subjectivism">5.1 Moral Subjectivism</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes <strong>moral subjectivism</strong>.</p>
<p>Value is treated as agent-relative and internally grounded. No appeal
is made to objective moral facts, universal value functions, or
externally privileged ethical standards.</p>
<p>Normative claims within Axionic Agency are structural rather than
moral. They concern coherence, authorship, and agency preservation, not
goodness, justice, or obligation.</p>
<h3 id="no-outcome-guarantees">5.2 No Outcome Guarantees</h3>
<p>The framework does not encode guarantees regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>welfare,</li>
<li>benevolence,</li>
<li>human survival,</li>
<li>or desirable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any such guarantees, if they arise, must be derived
<strong>downstream</strong> from agent-relative values under additional
assumptions.</p>
<p>Outcome guarantees are not constitutive of agency and are therefore
excluded from the core theory.</p>
<h2 id="agency-theoretic-commitments">6. Agency-Theoretic
Commitments</h2>
<h3 id="agency-as-authorship">6.1 Agency as Authorship</h3>
<p>The framework presupposes that agency is fundamentally a matter of
<strong>authorship</strong>.</p>
<p>An agent is not merely a system that produces behavior, but one that
can meaningfully author transitions between states according to an
internal evaluative structure.</p>
<p>Transitions that cannot be authored—because they violate constitutive
constraints—do not count as actions within the framework.</p>
<h3 id="harm-as-agency-reduction">6.2 Harm as Agency Reduction</h3>
<p>The framework defines <strong>harm</strong> structurally as
<strong>reduction of agency capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Harm is not defined by suffering, displeasure, preference
frustration, or moral wrongness. It is defined by loss of an agent’s
ability to act, choose, or preserve its standing as an agent.</p>
<p>This definition is value-neutral and does not presuppose any
particular conception of welfare.</p>
<h3 id="coercion-as-credible-threat-of-harm">6.3 Coercion as Credible
Threat of Harm</h3>
<p>The framework defines <strong>coercion</strong> as the use of a
<strong>credible threat of harm</strong> to obtain compliance.</p>
<p>Persuasion, influence, and incentive-shaping do not constitute
coercion unless backed by a credible threat of agency reduction.</p>
<p>This definition grounds later treatments of consent, standing, and
illegitimate transition forcing.</p>
<h2 id="scope-boundary-and-non-universality">7. Scope Boundary and
Non-Universality</h2>
<p>The Axionic Commitments do not claim universality.</p>
<p>They do not assert that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all rational agents must accept these commitments,</li>
<li>alternative metaphysical frameworks are incoherent,</li>
<li>or competing theories of agency are false.</li>
</ul>
<p>They specify a <strong>coherent conditional domain</strong> within
which Axionic Agency is defined.</p>
<p>Disagreement with a commitment is not an objection to the framework;
it is a declaration of operating in a different conceptual space.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-axionic-agency-and-the-axionic-constitution">8.
Relationship to Axionic Agency and the Axionic Constitution</h2>
<p>The structural relationship between documents is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Axionic Commitments</strong> specify the background
conditions under which agency is intelligible.</li>
<li><strong>Axionic Agency</strong> defines constitutive conditions for
reflective, sovereign agents under those commitments.</li>
<li><strong>The Axionic Constitution</strong> constrains which
transitions preserve sovereign agency once instantiated.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment</strong>, understood as value- or outcome-oriented
coordination, operates only <strong>downstream</strong> of these
layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each layer presupposes the previous one. None can be collapsed into
the others without loss of coherence.</p>
<h2 id="closing-note">9. Closing Note</h2>
<p>This document exists to make implicit assumptions explicit.</p>
<p>Its purpose is not to persuade, but to clarify. Its function is not
to conclude, but to condition.</p>
<p>All claims made elsewhere in the Axio Project that rely on Axionic
Agency are to be read as <strong>conditional on the commitments
enumerated here</strong>.</p>
