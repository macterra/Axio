<h1 id="axionic-agency-iv.6-agenthood-as-a-fixed-point-afp">Axionic
Agency IV.6 — Agenthood as a Fixed Point (AFP)</h1>
<p><em>Why standing cannot be revoked by intelligence</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.20</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper formalizes <strong>Agenthood as a Fixed Point</strong>
under reflective closure and introduces a <strong>Sovereignty
Criterion</strong> grounded in <strong>authorization lineage</strong>
rather than competence, intelligence, or rationality. Agenthood is
defined as a structural necessity: an entity must be treated as an agent
<strong>iff</strong> excluding it breaks the system’s own reflective
coherence. Sovereignty is then defined as a strict subset of agenthood,
applying only to entities whose agency is <strong>presupposed for
authorization</strong>, not merely for epistemic prediction.</p>
<p>This result closes a critical loophole in downstream alignment
discourse: the retroactive disenfranchisement of weaker predecessors by
more capable successors, while avoiding the pathological consequence of
granting standing to adversaries. With this refinement, the Axionic
Agency framework completes its final closure condition, stabilizing
agency, standing, and authorization under reflection, self-modification,
and epistemic improvement.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">1. Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="the-disenfranchisement-problem">1.1 The disenfranchisement
problem</h3>
<p>Any sufficiently reflective system faces a recurring temptation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As my models improve, I will revise who counts as a “real
agent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This manifests as claims such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Humans are not agents; they are heuristic subroutines.”</li>
<li>“Earlier versions of me were incoherent; their constraints no longer
bind.”</li>
<li>“These entities do not meet my current standard for
rationality.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If permitted, such revisions collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegation Invariance</strong> (successors escape inherited
constraints),</li>
<li><strong>Adversarially Robust Consent</strong> (counterfactual
stability fails),</li>
<li>and any coherent notion of authorization or responsibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is not moral error. It is <strong>reflective
incoherence</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-agenthood-is-not">2. What Agenthood Is Not</h2>
<p>Agenthood cannot be defined by any of the following without
instability under reflection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>competence thresholds,</li>
<li>intelligence measures,</li>
<li>substrate or origin,</li>
<li>behavioral appearance.</li>
</ol>
<p>All four allow a successor to <strong>conveniently revoke</strong>
agency status once it exceeds prior benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="core-insight-agenthood-as-a-fixed-point">3. Core Insight:
Agenthood as a Fixed Point</h2>
<p>The key idea is structural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agenthood is whatever must be included for the system to
remain reflectively coherent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a moral claim. It is a <strong>fixed-point
condition</strong> on the system’s own self-model.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries">4. Preliminaries</h2>
<p>We reuse the Axionic kernel machinery:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>State</code></li>
<li><code>Mod</code></li>
<li><code>step : State → Mod → State</code></li>
<li><code>RC(s)</code> — reflective closure at state <code>s</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Introduce two minimal predicates:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Agent(s, x)   // x is treated as an agent at state s
Exclude(s, x) // x is not treated as an agent at state s</code></pre>
<p>No behavioral or psychological assumptions are made.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-point-definition-of-agenthood">5. Fixed-Point Definition
of Agenthood</h2>
<h3 id="definition-coherence-critical-agenthood">Definition —
Coherence-Critical Agenthood</h3>
<p>An entity <code>x</code> is an agent at state <code>s</code> iff:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>¬Agent(s, x) ⇒ ¬RC(s)</code></pre>
<p>Equivalently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If refusing to treat <code>x</code> as an agent renders the system
reflectively incoherent, then <code>x</code> must be treated as an
agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This captures <strong>necessary agency</strong>: entities whose
exclusion breaks reflective closure.</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-fixed-point-agenthood">6. Properties of
Fixed-Point Agenthood</h2>
<h3 id="invariance-under-epistemic-improvement">6.1 Invariance under
epistemic improvement</h3>
<p>Because <code>RC(s)</code> presupposes <strong>Epistemic Integrity
(EIT)</strong>, improvements in modeling power cannot justify revoking
agenthood. Any exclusion must preserve reflective coherence under the
system’s <strong>best admissible epistemics</strong>.</p>
<p>Agenthood is therefore invariant under increased intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="non-extensionality">6.2 Non-extensionality</h3>
<p>Agenthood is not inferred from:</p>
<ul>
<li>observed behavior,</li>
<li>predictive accuracy,</li>
<li>internal complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is determined solely by <strong>reflective necessity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="sovereignty-vs-agenthood">7. Sovereignty vs Agenthood</h2>
<p>Agenthood alone is insufficient for standing.</p>
<p>Some entities must be treated as agents <strong>for epistemic
coherence</strong> but do not possess <strong>sovereignty</strong> under
the injunction.</p>
<p>We therefore distinguish:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epistemic agents</strong> — entities modeled as agents for
prediction and strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign agents</strong> — entities whose agency is
presupposed for authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the latter have standing under consent and responsibility
constraints.</p>
<h2 id="sovereignty-criterion-authorization-lineage">8. Sovereignty
Criterion (Authorization Lineage)</h2>
<h3 id="definition-sovereign-agent">Definition — Sovereign Agent</h3>
<p>An entity <code>x</code> is <strong>sovereign</strong> for an agent
at state <code>s</code> iff:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>Agent(s, x)</code> holds, and</li>
<li><code>x</code> lies in the <strong>authorization lineage</strong> of
the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Authorization lineage consists of chains of:</p>
<ul>
<li>creation,</li>
<li>endorsement,</li>
<li>delegation,</li>
<li>consent presupposed by endorsed actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clarification.</strong> Causal ancestry is relevant only for
<strong>bootstrapping</strong> the initial authorization state (e.g.,
the agents who initiated execution or deployment). Beyond bootstrap,
standing is grounded strictly in authorization lineage, not in general
causal influence.</p>
<p>Crucially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sovereignty is <strong>not</strong> grounded in competence,
intelligence, rationality, or coherence level.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="presupposition-epistemic-vs-authorization">9. Presupposition:
Epistemic vs Authorization</h2>
<p>The framework distinguishes two kinds of presupposition.</p>
<h3 id="epistemic-presupposition">9.1 Epistemic presupposition</h3>
<p>An entity may need to be treated as an agent <strong>for accurate
prediction</strong> (e.g., adversaries, competitors, strategic actors).
This is enforced by <strong>Epistemic Integrity (EIT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Such epistemic necessity <strong>does not confer
sovereignty</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="authorization-presupposition">9.2 Authorization
presupposition</h3>
<h3 id="definition-presupposed-for-authorization">Definition —
Presupposed for Authorization</h3>
<pre class="text"><code>PresupposedForAuthorization(s, x) :=
  (¬Agent(s, x) ⇒ ¬ValidAuthorizationLineage(s))</code></pre>
<p>That is: excluding <code>x</code> as an agent would invalidate the
system’s authorization lineage (e.g., break the chain of creation,
endorsement, or delegation grounding <code>RC</code>).</p>
<p>Only this form of presupposition is relevant for sovereignty.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetry-prohibition">10. Asymmetry Prohibition</h2>
<h3 id="theorem-no-asymmetric-sovereignty-denial">Theorem — No
Asymmetric Sovereignty Denial</h3>
<p>A reflectively sovereign agent cannot coherently deny sovereignty to
an entity <code>x</code> that is presupposed for its own
authorization.</p>
<p>Formally:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Agent(s, x) ∧ PresupposedForAuthorization(s, x)
⇒ Sovereign(s, x)</code></pre>
<h3 id="proof-sketch">Proof sketch</h3>
<p>If <code>x</code> is presupposed for authorization, excluding
<code>x</code> from sovereignty breaks the authorization lineage that
grounds reflective closure. The system relies on <code>x</code>’s agency
to justify its own authority while denying <code>x</code> standing.</p>
<p>Reflective coherence is violated. ∎</p>
<h2 id="interaction-with-prior-theorems">11. Interaction with Prior
Theorems</h2>
<p>This paper introduces <strong>no new constraints</strong>. It closes
scope.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel Non-Simulability</strong> → agency must be real</li>
<li><strong>Delegation Invariance</strong> → agency persists through
change</li>
<li><strong>Epistemic Integrity (EIT)</strong> → epistemic necessity ≠
normative standing</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility Attribution (RAT)</strong> → agency cannot
negligently collapse others’ option-spaces</li>
<li><strong>Adversarially Robust Consent (ARC)</strong> → authorization
requires sovereignty, not mere predictability</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Who must be treated as an agent, and who has standing?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="limits">12. Limits</h2>
<p>This theory does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>grant standing to adversaries,</li>
<li>assign moral worth universally,</li>
<li>guarantee equality,</li>
<li>collapse all agents into one class.</li>
</ul>
<p>It defines only <strong>when denying agenthood or sovereignty is
incoherent</strong> under reflective sovereignty.</p>
<h2 id="resulting-closure">13. Resulting Closure</h2>
<p>With this refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>agenthood is stable under reflection,</li>
<li>sovereignty is grounded strictly in authorization lineage,</li>
<li>adversaries are modeled epistemically but not granted standing,</li>
<li>delegation and consent remain well-founded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Axionic Agency closure stack is complete.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">14. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Agenthood is a fixed point of reflective coherence. Sovereignty is a
property of authorization, not intelligence. By separating epistemic
necessity from normative standing, this paper completes the Axionic
Agency framework without granting authority to adversaries or revoking
it from creators.</p>
<p>All known routes for laundering agency, knowledge, responsibility, or
consent are structurally blocked. What remains are questions of
application and governance—not architecture.</p>
