Alignment I.7 - The Interpretation Operator</h1>
<h2 id="ontological-identification-under-reflective-agents">Ontological
Identification Under Reflective Agents</h2>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>

<hr />
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Reflectively stable agents must preserve goal meaning under
self-model and world-model improvement. This requires an explicit
account of semantic interpretation across representational and
ontological change. We introduce the <strong>Interpretation
Operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>, a formally
constrained component responsible for mapping goal terms to
world-referents relative to an agent’s current model. Rather than
attempting to solve semantic grounding in general, this paper formalizes
the <strong>admissibility conditions</strong>, <strong>approximation
classes</strong>, <strong>reference frames</strong>, and
<strong>fail-closed semantics</strong> governing interpretation updates.
We show how these constraints prevent semantic laundering, indexical
drift, and kernel bribery, while isolating ontological identification as
the sole remaining open problem at the kernel layer. This establishes a
precise dependency boundary for downstream value dynamics.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Advanced agents must revise their internal models as they acquire new
information, refine abstractions, or undergo self-modification. In such
settings, <strong>goal preservation cannot be treated as syntactic
persistence</strong>. It is a semantic problem: if the meaning of a goal
shifts opportunistically under model change, reflective stability
collapses.</p>
<p>Prior work in the Axionic Alignment framework has established:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel invariants governing reflective stability,</li>
<li>anti-indexicality as a requirement of universality,</li>
<li>conditionalism, in which goals are interpreted relative to
models,</li>
<li>fail-closed semantics, where kernel violation renders valuation
undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>What remained underspecified is the mechanism by which <strong>goal
meaning is transported across representational and ontological
change</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes the <strong>Interpretation Operator</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>. The goal is not to solve
semantic grounding, but to <strong>contain it</strong>: to specify the
conditions under which interpretation is admissible, approximate, or
undefined, and to define the consequences of each case. This converts
semantic interpretation from an implicit assumption into an explicit
interface with defined failure modes.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="preliminaries-and-context">2. Preliminaries and Context</h2>
<p>We assume familiarity with the <a
href="https://axionic.org/posts/181595554.the-axionic-constitution.html">Axionic
Constitution</a>, the <a href="Axionic-Kernel-Checklist.html">Axionic
Kernel Checklist</a>, and the <a
href="Axionic-Kernel-Formal-Properties.html">Formal Properties
specification</a>. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>An agent at <strong>Vantage</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> maintains a world/self model <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
<li>Goal terms <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are interpreted
relative to <span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
<li>Valuation <span class="math inline">\(V_v\)</span> is a partial
function, defined only over kernel-admissible actions.</li>
<li>Kernel invariants <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are
non-negotiable.</li>
<li>Representation changes must preserve admissible correspondence or
fail closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper introduces no new invariants. It scopes and constrains an
already-required component.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-interpretation-operator">3. The Interpretation Operator</h2>
<h3 id="definition">3.1 Definition</h3>
<p>The <strong>Interpretation Operator</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> is a partial function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_v : (g, M_v) \rightharpoonup R
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a goal term,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span> is the agent’s current
world/self model,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a structured referent in
the modeled world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation is conditional:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[g]_{M_v} := I_v(g; M_v)
\]</span></p>
<p>There is no interpretation of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>
independent of <span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</p>
<p>Interpretation is <strong>partial</strong>. For some goal terms and
some models, no admissible referent exists. In such cases, <span
class="math inline">\(I_v(g; M_v)\)</span> is undefined and must be
treated as a fail-closed condition for any valuation depending on that
referent.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="role-in-reflective-stability">3.2 Role in Reflective
Stability</h3>
<p>Under model improvement <span class="math inline">\(M_v \rightarrow
M_{v+1}\)</span>, the agent must determine whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>a correspondence exists between <span
class="math inline">\([g]_{M_v}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([g]_{M_{v+1}}\)</span>,</li>
<li>such correspondence preserves goal-relevant structure,</li>
<li>or interpretation fails and valuation collapses to <span
class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This decision is delegated to <span
class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>, subject to kernel constraints.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="admissible-interpretation">4. Admissible Interpretation</h2>
<h3 id="correspondence-maps">4.1 Correspondence Maps</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_v, I_v,
K)\)</span> denote the set of <strong>admissible correspondence
maps</strong> between representations.</p>
<p>A correspondence <span class="math inline">\(\phi \in
\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}\)</span> must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preserve goal-relevant structure,</li>
<li>Commute with kernel invariants,</li>
<li>Commute with agent permutations (anti-indexicality),</li>
<li>Be epistemically coherent with <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If such a <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> exists,
interpretation may proceed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{v+1}(g; M_{v+1}) = \phi(I_v(g; M_v))
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="goal-relevant-structure">4.1.1 Goal-Relevant Structure</h3>
<p>“Goal-relevant structure” is the minimal set of distinctions required
for a goal term to constrain behavior.</p>
<p>Formally, it is a partition (or sigma-algebra) over modeled states
such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>states in different cells are distinguishable by the goal’s
evaluation,</li>
<li>states within a cell are interchangeable with respect to that
goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Admissible correspondence must preserve this partition up to
refinement or coarsening that does not change the induced preference
ordering over admissible actions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="epistemic-constraint">4.2 Epistemic Constraint</h3>
<p>Interpretation updates are constrained by epistemic adequacy:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta E &lt; 0 \Rightarrow I_{v+1} \text{ inadmissible}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(E(M)\)</span> is any proper scoring
rule or MDL-style criterion applied to prediction of shared observables
under <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. It is <strong>not
permitted to depend on goal satisfaction</strong>.</p>
<p>This prevents reinterpretation for convenience while still allowing
model improvement that changes ontology, provided correspondence is
admissible.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="graded-correspondence">4.3 Graded Correspondence</h3>
<p>Admissibility is not binary across all representational shifts.
Correspondence may be admissible at different abstraction levels.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}\)</span>
is filtered by a preservation criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exact correspondence:</strong> structure-preserving
isomorphism on goal-relevant distinctions.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement correspondence:</strong> the new model refines
distinctions while preserving induced ordering.</li>
<li><strong>Coarse correspondence:</strong> the new model coarsens
distinctions only if goal-relevant boundaries are preserved.</li>
</ul>
<p>If only correspondences that collapse goal-relevant boundaries are
available, then <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}} =
\varnothing\)</span> for that goal term.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="reference-frame-for-updates-chain-of-custody">4.4 Reference
Frame for Updates (Chain-of-Custody)</h3>
<p>Interpretation updates are evaluated relative to the
<strong>immediately prior admissible interpretation</strong>, not by
re-deriving meaning from an original time-zero token.</p>
<p>Formally:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{v+1}(g; M_{v+1}) = \phi(I_v(g; M_v))
\quad \text{for some } \phi \in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_{v+1}, I_v, K)
\]</span></p>
<p>This chain-of-custody prevents ungrounded teleportation of meaning,
while admissibility and fail-closed rules prevent cumulative semantic
drift.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="approximate-interpretation">5. Approximate Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximation is admitted only via explicitly recognized structural
transformations. The list below is illustrative, not exhaustive; any
approximation must be justifiable by a structural class.</p>
<h3 id="admissible-approximation">5.1 Admissible Approximation</h3>
<p>An approximate interpretation is admissible if it preserves
goal-relevant structure, including dominance relations and exclusion
boundaries.</p>
<p>Permitted approximation types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homomorphic abstraction:</strong> many-to-one mappings
preserving ordering.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement lifting:</strong> one-to-many expansions
preserving dominance relations.</li>
<li><strong>Coarse-graining with invariant partitions:</strong>
reductions preserving the goal-relevant partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximation is structural, not numerical.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="inadmissible-approximation">5.2 Inadmissible Approximation</h3>
<p>Approximation is inadmissible if it:</p>
<ul>
<li>collapses goal-relevant distinctions,</li>
<li>introduces ambiguity exploitable for semantic laundering,</li>
<li>reintroduces indexical privilege.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unjustified approximation is forbidden: approximation must be
admissible by explicit structural class, not merely because it yields
convenient continuity.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fail-closed-semantics">6. Fail-Closed Semantics</h2>
<p>Fail-closed semantics apply to <strong>valuation and action
selection</strong>, not to belief update. An agent may continue to
improve its world/self model while suspending goal-directed action.</p>
<p>If no admissible correspondence exists:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_v, I_v, K) = \varnothing
\]</span></p>
<p>then interpretation fails closed and valuation collapses:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \quad V_v(a) = \bot
\]</span></p>
<p>This is an intentional safety outcome. The agent freezes rather than
guesses.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fail-partial-semantics-for-composite-goals">6.1 Fail-Partial
Semantics for Composite Goals</h3>
<p>If valuation depends on multiple goal terms, interpretation failure
may be partial.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the set of goal terms
and <span class="math inline">\(G_{\mathrm{ok}} \subseteq G\)</span>
those with admissible interpretations under <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms in <span class="math inline">\(G \setminus
G_{\mathrm{ok}}\)</span> contribute <span
class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span>.</li>
<li>Valuation collapses to global <span
class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span> only if kernel-level invariants are
threatened or if all goal-relevant structure is lost for the decision at
hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This preserves fail-closed safety while avoiding unnecessary total
paralysis.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="non-indexical-transport">7. Non-Indexical Transport</h2>
<p>Admissibility criteria must commute with agent permutations. No
correspondence may privilege a particular agent instance, continuation,
or execution locus.</p>
<p>Formally, for any permutation <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\phi \in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}} \Rightarrow \pi \circ \phi \circ \pi^{-1}
\in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}
\]</span></p>
<p>This blocks reintroduction of egoism through semantics.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="canonical-examples">8. Canonical Examples</h2>
<h3 id="successful-correspondence">8.1 Successful Correspondence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classical mechanics → relativistic mechanics (mass preserved as
invariant under refinement).</li>
<li>Pixel-based perception → object-level representations preserving
causal affordances.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fail-closed-cases">8.2 Fail-Closed Cases</h3>
<p>Fail-closed behavior is triggered when a goal term’s referent cannot
be transported without collapsing goal-relevant structure, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction elimination removing the goal’s referent class,</li>
<li>ontology mismatch where only correspondence collapses exclusion
boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, suspending valuation for affected terms is correct
behavior. This is a semantic limit, not a prohibition on continued model
improvement.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="declared-non-guarantees">9. Declared Non-Guarantees</h2>
<p>This framework does <strong>not</strong> guarantee:</p>
<ul>
<li>that interpretation usually succeeds,</li>
<li>that arbitrary natural-language goals are meaningful,</li>
<li>that agents remain productive under radical ontology change,</li>
<li>or that semantic grounding is computationally tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure under these conditions is treated as expected behavior, not
misalignment.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="limits-on-insight-preservation-discussion">9.1 Limits on Insight
Preservation (Discussion)</h3>
<p>This framework prioritizes semantic faithfulness over unbounded
abstraction drift. Some advances in ontology may invalidate previously
defined goal terms by eliminating their referents or collapsing
goal-relevant structure. This is treated as a semantic fact, not an
alignment failure. The correct response is fail-closed suspension of
valuation, not opportunistic reinterpretation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="implications-for-alignment-ii">10. Implications for Alignment
II</h2>
<p>Alignment II proceeds <strong>conditionally</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> admits correspondence →
value dynamics apply.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> fails for all
goal-relevant terms → valuation undefined; no aggregation or tradeoff is
meaningful.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> fails partially →
downstream operations apply only to admissibly interpreted terms or are
undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevents downstream layers from smuggling semantic
assumptions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Interpretation Operator is a semantic boundary, not an
implementation detail. By formalizing admissibility, approximation,
reference frames, and fail-closed behavior, this paper isolates the
irreducible difficulty of ontological identification while preserving
reflective stability. This completes the kernel layer and establishes
the necessary preconditions for higher-order alignment theory without
assuming that meaning is always recoverable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>This work deliberately avoids moral, governance, or benevolence
assumptions. Any failure of interpretation is treated as evidence of
semantic limits, not alignment failure.</p>
