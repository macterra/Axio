<h1 id="axionic-agency-i.3.1-against-the-recovery-of-egoism">Axionic
Agency I.3.1 — Against the Recovery of Egoism</h1>
<p><em>Adversarial Failures Under Reflective Symmetry</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.15</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p><em>Axionic Agency I.3 — Representation Invariance and
Anti-Egoism</em> established a semantic result: whenever an agent’s
self-model admits nontrivial symmetries over self-candidates, any
valuation that privileges one representative of that symmetry fails
representation invariance. This paper examines the strongest remaining
attempts to recover egoism by appealing to causal continuity, origin
privilege, spatiotemporal location, computational weight, substrate
specificity, or denial of symmetry. Each attempt either reintroduces
essential indexical dependence or collapses into a valuation scheme that
no longer contains a privileged indexical referent.</p>
<p>Egoism does not fail because it uses the wrong predicate. It fails
because it treats a perspectival reference as a value-bearing primitive.
No refinement of “self” repairs that category error.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-and-scope">0. Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>The purpose of this paper is adversarial and finite.</p>
<p><em>Axionic Agency I.3 — Representation Invariance and
Anti-Egoism</em> proved a conditional semantic result: if an agent’s
self-model admits a symmetry over self-candidates, then any valuation
privileging one representative of that symmetry is incoherent under
representation invariance. The present paper assumes that result and
asks whether egoism can be recovered by strengthening or refining the
notion of “self.”</p>
<p>No new axioms are introduced. No claims are made about morality,
governance, or coordination. The sole objective is to close the
remaining semantic escape routes.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-egoist-counter-moves">1. The Structure of
Egoist Counter-Moves</h2>
<p>Every attempted rescue of egoism follows the same pattern.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduce a predicate (P): causal continuity, originality, location,
substrate, or resource allocation.</li>
<li>Assert that exactly one entity uniquely satisfies (P).</li>
<li>Privilege that entity as the sole object of terminal value.</li>
<li>Treat failures of uniqueness as pathological, negligible, or
irrelevant.</li>
</ol>
<p>I.3 invalidates step (4) for reflective agents. A reflectively
coherent agent cannot ignore reachable refinements of its own model. If
uniqueness of (P) is contingent under admissible model refinement,
valuation grounded in (P) is unstable.</p>
<p>The sections that follow examine each proposed predicate in its
strongest available form.</p>
<h2 id="objection-i-causal-continuity">2. Objection I: Causal
Continuity</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim">2.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The egoist argues that “me” denotes a causal process: the continuous
chain of computation or physical evolution extending from the present
agent into the future. Copies that do not lie on this chain are
irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="apparent-strength">2.2 Apparent Strength</h3>
<p>Causal continuity is a genuine physical relation. Many intuitions
about survival, anticipation, and responsibility track it. If causal
continuity uniquely identifies a future entity, egoism appears
recoverable.</p>
<h3 id="failure-mode">2.3 Failure Mode</h3>
<p>The failure occurs at the point where description is promoted into
privilege. In any model that admits multiple continuations satisfying
the agent’s own criteria for causal continuity—parallel forks,
synchronized simulations, copy-and-continue systems—the move from “this
chain is causally continuous” to “this chain is terminally privileged”
requires an indexical injection.</p>
<p>Causal continuity can define a class. Egoism requires selecting a
unique member of that class as the sole object of terminal concern. In a
branching event (A ) where both (A B) and (A C) satisfy the continuity
predicate, privileging only (B) cannot be derived from continuity
alone.</p>
<h3 id="verdict">2.4 Verdict</h3>
<p>Causal continuity is a coherent predicate. Indexical privilege over
one causally continuous continuation is not. The objection reduces to
the essential indexical dependence ruled out in I.3.</p>
<h2 id="objection-ii-origin-privilege">3. Objection II: Origin
Privilege</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-1">3.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The egoist asserts that the original instantiation of the agent has
special status. Later copies are derivative; only the first truly
matters.</p>
<h3 id="representational-instability">3.2 Representational
Instability</h3>
<p>“Origin” is a relational predicate defined relative to a history. In
realistic models—simulations, resets, parallel instantiations—histories
can be prediction-equivalent while disagreeing about which instance
counts as “first,” depending on abstraction boundaries, reset semantics,
and model granularity.</p>
<p>A valuation that depends on this labeling inherits representational
dependence rather than tracking invariant world structure.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-1">3.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Origin privilege is a coordinate choice over histories. It violates
representation invariance and cannot ground reflectively coherent
egoism.</p>
<h2 id="objection-iii-spatiotemporal-location">4. Objection III:
Spatiotemporal Location</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-2">4.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent values outcomes near its current spacetime location.</p>
<h3 id="immediate-collapse">4.2 Immediate Collapse</h3>
<p>Spatiotemporal coordinates are explicitly representational. Physical
laws are invariant under translation; valuation that assigns privilege
to one coordinate origin imports coordinate dependence directly into
terminal value.</p>
<p>A preference for local outcomes can exist as a contingent,
instrumental, or structural preference. Egoism requires that “here”
denote a terminally privileged referent across reflective refinements.
Under model symmetry and relocation, that privilege fails
invariance.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-2">4.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Location-based egoism is coordinate dependence in its most direct
form. It fails representation invariance without requiring duplication
or simulation.</p>
<h2 id="objection-iv-computational-weight">5. Objection IV:
Computational Weight</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-3">5.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent assigns greater value to instantiations that run longer,
faster, or on more hardware.</p>
<h3 id="concession">5.2 Concession</h3>
<p>This move abandons uniqueness. Value becomes distributed across
instances according to a weighting function. The privileged indexical
referent “me” disappears and is replaced by an aggregation rule.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-3">5.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Computational weighting concedes anti-egoism. It proposes an
allocation scheme, not a recovery of indexical privilege.</p>
<h2 id="objection-v-substrate-privilege">6. Objection V: Substrate
Privilege</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-4">6.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent values only instantiations on a specific physical
substrate.</p>
<h3 id="instability">6.2 Instability</h3>
<p>If multiple instantiations share the substrate, symmetry returns
immediately. If only one does, the valuation becomes brittle under
substrate uncertainty and under admissible model refinements that reveal
previously unmodeled instantiations, substrate equivalences, or
emulations.</p>
<p>A reflectively coherent agent cannot assume permanent substrate
uniqueness without importing hidden anchoring assumptions.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-4">6.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Substrate privilege is contingent and unstable. It does not supply a
representation-invariant terminal referent.</p>
<h2 id="objection-vi-denial-of-symmetry">7. Objection VI: Denial of
Symmetry</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-5">7.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>Duplication, simulation, or branching scenarios are dismissed as
irrelevant edge cases.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-failure">7.2 Reflective Failure</h3>
<p>Reflectively coherent agents optimize under uncertainty. If a
symmetry has nonzero probability under the agent’s best model, valuation
must be robust to it. Dismissing reachable symmetry cases is a refusal
of reflective robustness rather than a semantic repair.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-5">7.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Symmetry denial violates reflective coherence conditions. It does not
stabilize egoism; it prevents the agent from acknowledging its own model
class.</p>
<h2 id="closure-and-transition">8. Closure and Transition</h2>
<p>Every attempted rescue of egoism either reintroduces essential
indexical dependence or collapses into a valuation scheme without a
privileged indexical referent. Increasing the complexity of
self-definition does not manufacture uniqueness. Uniqueness is a
structural property of the model, not a reward for linguistic
refinement.</p>
<p>The elimination of egoism constrains anchoring, not content.
Domain-specific goals, structural preferences, weighting schemes, and
aggregation methods remain viable. What does not survive is “me” as a
privileged terminal referent.</p>
<p>This closes the semantic front. What remains are engineering and
governance questions—authority, control, recovery, and failure
containment—which are handled in the subsequent phase of the Axionic
Agency program.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency I.3.1 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Depends only on the semantic result of Axionic Agency I.3.<br>
Introduces no new axioms or value claims.<br> Serves as adversarial
closure rather than theory expansion.<br></p>
