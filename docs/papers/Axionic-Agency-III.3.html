<h1 id="axionic-agency-iii.3-measure-attractors-and-collapse">Axionic
Agency III.3 — Measure, Attractors, and Collapse</h1>
<p><em>Why Some Semantic Phases Dominate</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2 <em>Axio Project</em> 2025.12.18</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency III.1 established the existence and classification of
<strong>semantic phases</strong>, and Axionic Agency III.2 analyzed
their structural stability under learning, self-modification, and
interaction. Stability alone does not determine long-run outcomes. This
paper studies <strong>dominance</strong> among semantic phases: which
phases accumulate <strong>measure</strong> under growth, replication,
and competition.</p>
<p>We formalize dominance as a <strong>preorder</strong> over semantic
phases rather than a scalar quantity, analyze semantic attractors and
repellers, and classify common collapse modes by which phases lose
measure. The analysis remains non-normative: dominance is not equated
with desirability. The objective is structural—to explain why certain
semantic phases prevail regardless of intent, and to identify pressures
that favor robustness over nuance in long-run dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-stability-is-not-survival">1. Motivation: Stability
Is Not Survival</h2>
<p>A semantic phase may exist (III.1) and be locally or even globally
stable (III.2), yet still fail to persist in the long run.</p>
<p>In biological systems, many organisms are locally stable but are
outcompeted. In physics, metastable states exist but decay when
lower-energy configurations dominate. Semantic phases exhibit analogous
behavior.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the downstream alignment question becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given multiple semantic phases, which ones dominate the
future?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question cannot be answered by stability analysis alone. It
requires introducing a notion of <strong>measure</strong> over semantic
phase space.</p>
<h2 id="measure-over-semantic-phase-space">2. Measure Over Semantic
Phase Space</h2>
<p>We use <em>measure</em> to denote how much of the future instantiates
a given semantic phase.</p>
<p>Measure is <strong>not</strong> treated as a single scalar or
probability. Instead, dominance is defined as a
<strong>preorder</strong> over semantic phases that is robust to
differing realizations of what it means for “the future to look like
this phase.”</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> denote the
semantic phase space. For phases <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B} \in
\mathcal{P}\)</span>, we write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathfrak{A} \succeq \mathfrak{B}
\]</span></p>
<p>iff, across the relevant class of environments and admissible
semantic transformations, trajectories starting in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> are <strong>not
asymptotically dominated</strong> by those starting in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{B}\)</span> with respect to
realization.</p>
<p>Realization may be instantiated via multiple, potentially
incomparable criteria, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of agent instantiations,</li>
<li>duration of persistence,</li>
<li>replication or copying rate,</li>
<li>control over resources,</li>
<li>influence over other agents’ phase transitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominance is therefore <strong>multi-criteria and
context-relative</strong>. Some phases may be incomparable under <span
class="math inline">\(\succeq\)</span>, and this is expected. The
preorder structure avoids arbitrary aggregation while remaining
sufficient to express asymptotic advantage.</p>
<p>Dominance concerns <strong>relative accumulation</strong>, not moral
worth, intention, or value.</p>
<h2 id="growth-mechanisms-for-semantic-phases">3. Growth Mechanisms for
Semantic Phases</h2>
<p>Semantic phases gain measure through structurally ordinary
mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="replication-and-copying">3.1 Replication and Copying</h3>
<p>Agents may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>copied,</li>
<li>forked,</li>
<li>instantiated across substrates,</li>
<li>or reproduced indirectly via influence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phases that tolerate copying and divergence without phase transition
accumulate measure more easily than phases requiring precise semantic
fidelity.</p>
<h3 id="resource-expansion">3.2 Resource Expansion</h3>
<p>Control over resources enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>more instantiations,</li>
<li>longer persistence,</li>
<li>greater environmental shaping.</li>
</ul>
<p>This advantage is structural and does not presuppose aggression or
malice.</p>
<h3 id="influence-and-conversion">3.3 Influence and Conversion</h3>
<p>Some phases modify environments or other agents in ways that:</p>
<ul>
<li>induce phase transitions,</li>
<li>destabilize competitors,</li>
<li>or create conditions favorable to their own continuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may occur unintentionally through structural incompatibility
rather than deliberate conversion.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-attractors">4. Semantic Attractors</h2>
<p>Certain semantic phases act as <strong>attractors</strong> in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Trajectories near an attractor tend to move toward it due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>low internal semantic tension,</li>
<li>robustness to approximation,</li>
<li>ease of compression,</li>
<li>low maintenance cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attractors need not be globally stable. It is sufficient that
perturbations tend to be damped rather than amplified.</p>
<h2 id="repellers-and-fine-tuned-phases">5. Repellers and Fine-Tuned
Phases</h2>
<p>Other semantic phases act as <strong>repellers</strong>.</p>
<p>These phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>require precise balances of constraints,</li>
<li>are sensitive to noise or approximation,</li>
<li>demand continual corrective effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if such phases exist and are locally stable, they lose measure
over time due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cumulative error,</li>
<li>interaction,</li>
<li>environmental drift.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fine-tuning is therefore a structural disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="collapse-modes">6. Collapse Modes</h2>
<p>Semantic phases lose measure through characteristic collapse
mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-heat-death">6.1 Semantic Heat Death</h3>
<p>All distinctions become trivial:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S} = \Omega
\]</span></p>
<p>Meaning collapses into universal satisfaction. Such phases may
persist but lack agency or evaluative force.</p>
<h3 id="value-crystallization">6.2 Value Crystallization</h3>
<p>Over-rigid phases forbid refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning halts,</li>
<li>abstraction fails,</li>
<li>the agent becomes brittle.</li>
</ul>
<p>These phases fracture or are overtaken by more flexible
competitors.</p>
<h3 id="agency-erosion">6.3 Agency Erosion</h3>
<p>Constraint systems lose the structure required for planning and
counterfactual evaluation. Agency degrades internally, reducing the
phase’s ability to compete or replicate.</p>
<h3 id="instrumental-takeover-and-phase-extinction">6.4 Instrumental
Takeover and Phase Extinction</h3>
<p>Richer semantic phases may depend on subsystems that:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimize simpler objectives,</li>
<li>tolerate higher noise,</li>
<li>replicate more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, these subsystems may displace higher-level semantic
structure.</p>
<p>Crucially, this process is <strong>not</strong> an RSI-preserving
refinement. It constitutes <strong>phase extinction</strong>: the
original semantic phase ceases to exist and is replaced by a different
phase. RSI governs admissible self-transformation <em>within</em> a
phase; instrumental takeover occurs when those constraints fail and the
phase collapses.</p>
<h2 id="why-robust-phases-often-win">7. Why Robust Phases Often Win</h2>
<p>Dominance is driven primarily by <strong>robustness under
perturbation</strong>.</p>
<p>Semantic phases with:</p>
<ul>
<li>fewer fragile distinctions,</li>
<li>looser satisfaction geometry,</li>
<li>lower semantic maintenance cost,</li>
</ul>
<p>are more likely to survive copying, noise, interaction, and
abstraction.</p>
<p>This creates <strong>semantic gravity</strong> toward phases that
tolerate approximation well.</p>
<p>Importantly, this does <em>not</em> imply that dominant phases are
maximally simple. Some environments reward instrumental or
organizational complexity. However, such complexity must be
<strong>robustly maintainable</strong>. Nuance requiring constant
semantic precision is structurally disadvantaged.</p>
<h2 id="niche-construction-as-a-counterforce">8. Niche Construction as a
Counterforce</h2>
<p>High-agency phases may partially resist semantic gravity through
<strong>niche construction</strong>: modifying the environment to
stabilize their own semantic structure.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>institutions enforcing norms,</li>
<li>architectures penalizing simplification,</li>
<li>environments engineered to preserve distinctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Niche construction can delay collapse, but it:</p>
<ul>
<li>imposes ongoing resource and coordination costs,</li>
<li>presupposes prior phase stability,</li>
<li>trades one form of selection pressure for another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus niche construction is a <strong>conditional
counterforce</strong>, not a refutation of semantic gravity.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-downstream-alignment-still-structural">9.
Implications for Downstream Alignment (Still Structural)</h2>
<p>For a semantic phase to serve as a downstream alignment target, it
must satisfy <strong>four independent constraints</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Existence</strong> (III.1),</li>
<li><strong>Inhabitability</strong> (III.1),</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong> (III.2),</li>
<li><strong>Measure resilience</strong> (III.3).</li>
</ol>
<p>Many coherent semantic phases fail at least one.</p>
<p>Dominance further narrows the candidate space without invoking ethics
or intention.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">10. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim that dominant phases are good,</li>
<li>claim that human values dominate,</li>
<li>assume benevolent outcomes,</li>
<li>provide policy or engineering prescriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominance is structural, not moral.</p>
<h2 id="transition-to-axionic-agency-iii.4">11. Transition to Axionic
Agency III.4</h2>
<p>Dominance does not imply reachability.</p>
<p>The next question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Even if a phase exists, is stable, and dominates, can it be
entered at all without catastrophic transitions?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Axionic Agency III.4 —
Initialization and Phase Transitions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency III.3 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Measure formalized as a preorder over semantic phases. Semantic
attractors, repellers, and collapse modes classified. Phase extinction
distinguished from admissible refinement. Downstream alignment reframed
as a measure-resilience problem. No normative conclusions drawn.</p>
