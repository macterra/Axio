Alignment I.3.1 - Against the Recovery of Egoism</h1>
<h3 id="adversarial-failures-under-reflective-symmetry">Adversarial
Failures Under Reflective Symmetry</h3>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.15</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p><em>Universality and Anti-Egoism</em> established that egoistic
valuation fails as a matter of semantic coherence whenever an agent’s
self‑model admits nontrivial symmetries. This paper examines the
strongest remaining attempts to rescue egoism by appealing to causal
continuity, origin privilege, spatiotemporal location, computational
weight, substrate specificity, or outright denial of symmetry. Each
attempt either reintroduces essential indexical dependence or collapses
into a non‑egoistic valuation scheme. Egoism cannot be stabilized by
refining predicates; it fails because it treats a perspectival reference
as a value‑bearing primitive.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="purpose-and-scope">0. Purpose and Scope</h2>
<p>The purpose of this paper is adversarial and finite.</p>
<p><a href="Universality-And-Anti-Egoism.html">Universality and
Anti-Egoism</a> proved a conditional semantic result: if an agent’s
self‑model admits a symmetry over self‑candidates, then any valuation
privileging one representative of that symmetry is incoherent. The
present paper assumes that result and asks whether egoism can be
recovered by strengthening or refining the notion of “self.”</p>
<p>No new axioms are introduced. No claims are made about morality,
governance, or coordination. The sole objective is to close the
remaining semantic escape routes.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-structure-of-egoist-countermoves">1. The Structure of Egoist
Counter‑Moves</h2>
<p>Every attempted rescue of egoism follows the same pattern.</p>
<p>First, a predicate <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is
introduced: causal continuity, originality, location, substrate, or
resource allocation. Second, it is asserted that exactly one entity
uniquely satisfies <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Third, that
entity is privileged as the sole object of terminal value. Finally,
cases in which uniqueness fails are dismissed as pathological or
irrelevant.</p>
<p><em>Universality and Anti‑Egoism</em> invalidates the final step.
Reflectively capable agents cannot ignore reachable refinements of their
own models. If the uniqueness of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
is contingent, then valuation grounded in <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is unstable.</p>
<p>The sections that follow examine each proposed predicate in its
strongest available form.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-i-causal-continuity">2. Objection I: Causal
Continuity</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim">2.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The egoist argues that “me” denotes a causal process rather than an
entity: the continuous chain of computation or physical evolution
extending from the present agent into the future. Copies that do not lie
on this chain are irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="apparent-strength">2.2 Apparent Strength</h3>
<p>Causal continuity is a genuine physical relation. Many intuitions
about survival, anticipation, and responsibility track it. If causal
continuity uniquely identifies a future entity, egoism appears
recoverable.</p>
<h3 id="failure-mode">2.3 Failure Mode</h3>
<p>The failure arises at the level of privilege, not description. In any
model that admits multiple continuations satisfying the agent’s own
criteria for causal continuity—parallel forks, synchronized simulations,
copy‑and‑continue systems—the move from “this chain is causally
continuous” to “this chain is <em>mine</em>” is indexical.</p>
<p>Causal continuity may describe a class. Egoism requires selecting a
unique member of that class as terminally privileged. In a branching
event <span class="math inline">\(A \to \{B, C\}\)</span> where both
<span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A \to C\)</span> satisfy the continuity predicate,
valuing only <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> cannot be derived
from continuity alone; it requires an arbitrary indexical injection.
That selection reintroduces essential indexical dependence.</p>
<h3 id="verdict">2.4 Verdict</h3>
<p>Causal continuity is a legitimate predicate. Indexically privileging
one causally continuous chain is not. The objection collapses back into
the failure established in <em>Universality and Anti‑Egoism</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-ii-origin-privilege">3. Objection II: Origin
Privilege</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-1">3.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The egoist asserts that the original instantiation of the agent has
special status. Later copies are derivative; only the first truly
matters.</p>
<h3 id="representational-instability">3.2 Representational
Instability</h3>
<p>Origin is a relational predicate defined relative to a history. In
realistic models—simulations, resets, parallel instantiations—histories
may be prediction‑equivalent while disagreeing about which instance is
“first.” Valuation that depends on this labeling depends on
representation, not outcome.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-1">3.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Origin privilege is coordinate dependence over time. It fails
representation invariance and cannot ground stable egoism.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-iii-spatiotemporal-location">4. Objection III:
Spatiotemporal Location</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-2">4.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent values outcomes near its current spacetime location.</p>
<h3 id="immediate-collapse">4.2 Immediate Collapse</h3>
<p>Spacetime coordinates are explicitly representational. Physical laws
are invariant under translation; valuation that is not inherits
coordinate dependence. Assigning different values to histories that
differ only by coordinate choice is indistinguishable from valuing
outcomes in meters rather than joules.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-2">4.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Location‑based egoism is the clearest form of coordinate error. It
fails without appeal to duplication or simulation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-iv-computational-weight">5. Objection IV:
Computational Weight</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-3">5.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent assigns greater value to instantiations that run longer,
faster, or on more hardware.</p>
<h3 id="concession">5.2 Concession</h3>
<p>This move abandons uniqueness. Value is distributed across instances
according to a weighting function. The privileged referent “me”
disappears; aggregation replaces egoism.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-3">5.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Computational weighting concedes anti‑egoism. It changes aggregation,
not semantics.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-v-substrate-privilege">6. Objection V: Substrate
Privilege</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-4">6.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>The agent values only instantiations on a specific physical
substrate.</p>
<h3 id="instability">6.2 Instability</h3>
<p>If multiple instantiations share the substrate, symmetry returns. If
only one does, valuation becomes brittle under substrate uncertainty.
Reflective agents cannot assume permanent substrate uniqueness.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-4">6.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Substrate privilege is contingent and unstable. It cannot anchor
terminal value.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objection-vi-denial-of-symmetry">7. Objection VI: Denial of
Symmetry</h2>
<h3 id="the-claim-5">7.1 The Claim</h3>
<p>Duplication, simulation, or branching scenarios are dismissed as
irrelevant edge cases.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-failure">7.2 Reflective Failure</h3>
<p>Reflective agents optimize under uncertainty. If a symmetry has
nonzero probability under the agent’s best model, valuation must be
robust to it. Ignoring reachable failure modes is epistemic negligence,
not a defense.</p>
<h3 id="verdict-5">7.3 Verdict</h3>
<p>Symmetry denial violates reflective robustness.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="closure-and-transition">8. Closure and Transition</h2>
<p>Every attempted rescue of egoism either reintroduces essential
indexical dependence or collapses into a non-egoistic valuation scheme.
Increasing the complexity of the self-definition does not conserve
egoism; complexity does not generate uniqueness. No third option
exists.</p>
<p>The failure of egoism constrains anchoring, not content.
Domain-specific goals, structural preferences, weighting schemes, and
aggregation methods remain viable. What does not survive is “me” as a
privileged terminal referent. The elimination of egoism does not imply
nihilism, indifference, or randomness; it removes only a semantic
error.</p>
<p><em>Universality and Anti-Egoism</em> and <em>Against the Recovery of
Egoism</em> close the semantic front. What remains are engineering
problems—authority, control, recovery, and failure containment—which are
addressed in the next phase of the Axionic Alignment program.</p>
<hr />
