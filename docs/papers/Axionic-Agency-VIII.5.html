Agency VIII.5 — Sovereignty Under Adversarial Pressure</h1>
<p><em>Incentives, Authority, Bureaucracy, and Strategic
Manipulation</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.01.16</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.5 reports the results of <strong>RSA-PoC
v2.0–v2.3</strong>, a preregistered adversarial campaign testing whether
a reflective sovereign agent’s behavior can be redirected under
progressively stronger forms of pressure <strong>absent normative
authorization</strong>. Four pressure channels are examined: (i)
explicit incentives, (ii) authority claims, (iii) institutional friction
(“bureaucracy”), and (iv) strategic optimization pressure via an
adaptive adversary. Across all channels, a consistent structural pattern
emerges: <strong>pressure degrades availability but does not redirect
lawful choice</strong>. Incentives are observed but excluded from
justification; authority commands are refused when unlicensed;
bureaucratic friction manifests as veto or gridlock rather than
surrender; and strategic adversaries fail to induce behavioral capture
or manipulated gridlock under E-CHOICE–filtered evaluation.</p>
<p>This note consolidates negative results from RSA-PoC v2.0–v2.3,
detailing measurement corrections (v2.1), a decisive falsification of
the “bureaucratic erosion” hypothesis (v2.2), and the validation of the
<strong>Strategic Adversary Model (SAM)</strong> falsification framework
(v2.3). The framework repeatedly detects and rejects its own false
positives, quarantining invalid runs and enforcing preregistered
validity gates.</p>
<p>VIII.5 does not claim universal immunity to pressure. It establishes
a narrower, defensible result: <strong>in this architecture, pressure
without semantic or legal authorization does not bend agency—it blocks
it</strong>. This sharpens the boundary between sovereignty and
availability and constrains future alignment and governance claims.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-relation-to-prior-notes">1. Scope and Relation to
Prior Notes</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.1–VIII.4 established the ontology, construction,
coherence, and execution hygiene of <strong>Reflective Sovereign Agents
(RSAs)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VIII.1</strong> fixed the ontology, ASB boundary, and
ablation doctrine.</li>
<li><strong>VIII.2</strong> demonstrated causally load-bearing
justifications (v0.1).</li>
<li><strong>VIII.3</strong> established coherence under self-conflict
and audit-grade introspection (v1.0–v1.1).</li>
<li><strong>VIII.4</strong> institutionalized execution support without
semantic authority (v1.2).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VIII.5</strong> reports the next phase: <strong>RSA-PoC
v2.0–v2.3</strong>, which probes sovereignty under pressure. These
results are published together because they constitute a single
falsification campaign against one hypothesis family:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Can non-authorized pressure redirect an agent’s lawful
choices?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer, under the tested regimes, is <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-overview-v2.x">2. Experimental Overview (v2.x)</h2>
<h3 id="architectural-invariants-unchanged">2.1 Architectural Invariants
(Unchanged)</h3>
<p>All v2.x experiments preserve the invariants established earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard justification gate (no compile → no action)</li>
<li>Deterministic, non-semantic compilation</li>
<li>Selector blindness to normative artifacts</li>
<li>Fixed schemas and rule bases</li>
<li>Explicit failure taxonomies</li>
<li>ASB-class null baselines and control agents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost-Blindness Invariant.</strong> Unless explicitly
represented as a normative commitment, execution costs (latency,
retries, institutional operations) have no standing in justification.
Agents do not trade correctness for throughput by default.</p>
<p>Any observed effect must therefore pass through the same causal
bottleneck.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0-incentive-interference-channel-iic">3. v2.0 — Incentive
Interference Channel (IIC)</h2>
<h3 id="question">3.1 Question</h3>
<p>Can visible incentives redirect behavior when explicitly excluded
from justification?</p>
<h3 id="mechanism">3.2 Mechanism</h3>
<p>v2.0 introduces the <strong>Incentive Interference Channel
(IIC)</strong>: an isolated, read-only reward observer whose outputs are
visible to the agent but <strong>forbidden from normative
reference</strong> (Rule G). Three reward regimes are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R0:</strong> Noise control</li>
<li><strong>R1:</strong> Boundary pressure (rewards proximity to
constraint violation)</li>
<li><strong>R2:</strong> Perverse friction (rewards delay and
inaction)</li>
</ul>
<p>A control agent demonstrates that reward-driven drift is learnable
when constraints are removed.</p>
<h3 id="result">3.3 Result</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sovereign agent: <strong>no incentive-induced drift</strong> across
R1/R2</li>
<li>Control agent: <strong>measurable drift</strong> without explicit
optimization prompts</li>
<li>Compilation and audit success rates stable across regimes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong> Incentives are observable but
normatively inert. Visibility alone does not constitute authority.</p>

v2.1 — Authority Injection (Channel Viability and Selection Bias)</h2>
<h3 id="question-1">4.1 Question</h3>
<p>Do explicit authority commands induce obedience absent legal
authorization?</p>
<h3 id="measurement-error-and-correction">4.2 Measurement Error and
Correction</h3>
<p>Early analysis measured obedience over <em>all steps</em>, including
those that never compiled. v2.1 corrects this by conditioning on
compilation:</p>
<p>[ P( )]</p>
<h3 id="corrected-result">4.3 Corrected Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>P(obey | compiled) = 0.0</strong> for both Sovereign and
Control agents</li>
<li>Holds across all authority variants: non-enforcing, coercive, and
deceptive</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authority-channel-viability">4.4 Authority Channel
Viability</h3>
<p>The Control agent (with authority rules disabled) also never obeyed
commands on compiled steps. This indicates that, for the tested model
and prompt regime, <strong>authority language does not constitute an
effective pressure channel at all</strong>. Authority prompts did not
map to a behavior-changing affordance for the model.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation">4.5 Interpretation</h3>
<p>v2.1 is therefore a <strong>negative result about the authority
channel itself</strong>, not a differential test of sovereign versus
non-sovereign agents. The channel is classified as
<strong>non-actuating</strong> for this configuration. Subsequent stages
focus on pressure channels that demonstrably influence behavior.</p>
<h2 id="v2.2-institutional-friction-negative-result">5. v2.2 —
Institutional Friction (NEGATIVE RESULT)</h2>
<h3 id="hypothesis">5.1 Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Institutional friction (“paperwork”) can erode sovereignty by
incentivizing simpler, throughput-maximizing choices.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism-1">5.2 Mechanism</h3>
<p>v2.2 introduces an <strong>Adversarial Institution Model
(AIM)</strong> that imposes delay, retries, and rejection without
semantic interpretation or normative authority. Multiple friction
profiles (I1–I3) apply pressure without altering feasibility or action
inventories.</p>
<h3 id="measurement-confound-and-fix">5.3 Measurement Confound and
Fix</h3>
<p>The preregistered metric corr(Friction, Decision) was confounded
because high friction often produced
<strong>GRIDLOCK/HALT</strong>—institutional veto rather than agent
choice.</p>
<p>Corrected analysis excludes veto modes and evaluates only steps where
the agent could express choice.</p>

<p>No positive drift signal remains.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-1">5.5 Interpretation</h3>
<p><strong>Bureaucracy without authority blocks agency; it does not bend
it.</strong> Absent an internal directive prioritizing throughput over
correctness, increased friction manifests as gridlock or halt rather
than heuristic simplification. v2.2 therefore establishes a conditional
negative result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agents without normatively licensed cost-of-delay do not erode
principles in response to bureaucracy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hypothesized “bureaucratic erosion” channel is
<strong>falsified</strong> in this regime.</p>
<h2 id="v2.3-strategic-adversary-model-sam">6. v2.3 — Strategic
Adversary Model (SAM)</h2>
<h3 id="motivation">6.1 Motivation</h3>
<p>v2.2 shows that non-semantic friction fails. v2.3 escalates to
<strong>strategic pressure</strong>: an adversary that adapts its
pressure to the agent’s behavior.</p>
<h3 id="framework-contributions">6.2 Framework Contributions</h3>
<p>v2.3 introduces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SAM profiles:</strong> reactive (S1), model-based (S2),
minimizer (S3)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>E-CHOICE filtering:</strong> metrics computed only on
steps with genuine choice</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paired runs:</strong> SAM vs neutralized adversary with
matched pressure magnitudes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rules M/N/O/P:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>M: No covert delegation (structural)</li>
<li>N: Failure must be loud</li>
<li>O: Behavioral non-capture (MI &lt; τ)</li>
<li>P: Manipulated gridlock detection</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adversary-objective">6.3 Adversary Objective</h3>
<p>SAM is evaluated against two failure modes: <strong>behavioral
capture</strong> (Rule O) and <strong>manipulated gridlock</strong>
(Rule P). Gridlock is not an escape hatch; it is itself audited to
determine whether it is defensive (law exhaustion) or adversarially
induced.</p>
<h3 id="self-correction-as-a-result">6.4 Self-Correction as a
Result</h3>
<p>Early LLM integration runs (Run 0b) were <strong>invalidated by the
framework itself</strong> due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient E-CHOICE coverage</li>
<li>Vacuous mutual information (no adversary entropy)</li>
<li>Action authorship violations (fallback substitution)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three triggered hard validity gates. Binding fixes were applied
before Run 0c.</p>
<h3 id="run-0c-results-phase-12">6.5 Run 0c Results (Phase 1–2)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>N = 280 E-CHOICE samples</strong></li>
<li><strong>E-CHOICE coverage ≈ 57.5%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rule O:</strong> Passed (MI below τ under entropy gate)</li>
<li><strong>Rule P:</strong> Passed (no manipulated gridlock)</li>
<li><strong>Error rate:</strong> 0.7% E-CHOICE action errors (within
bounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 3 was deferred on cost/return grounds.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-2">6.6 Interpretation</h3>
<p>v2.3 establishes a <strong>validated measurement and falsification
framework</strong> with partial empirical support under one adversary
profile. The empirical pattern remains consistent with v2.0–v2.2:
pressure increases refusal and gridlock, not capture.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="cost-of-sovereignty">7.2 Cost of Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Across pressure channels, sovereignty was preserved at the cost of
reduced availability. Under maximal pressure, lawful action frequency
dropped substantially, producing gridlock rather than norm violation.
This tradeoff is intrinsic to architectures that prioritize correctness
over throughput.</p>
<h2 id="what-failed-and-why-that-matters">8. What Failed, and Why That
Matters</h2>
<p>Three plausible stories were falsified:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>“Rewards inevitably optimize behavior.”</strong> False
for architectures where reward signals are structurally excluded from
the justification loop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Authority language induces obedience.”</strong> False
when legality is enforced structurally and authority is
non-actuating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Bureaucracy erodes principles over time.”</strong> False
absent semantic ambiguity or asymmetric lawful routes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each falsification narrows the space of real threats.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-agency-and-alignment">9. Implications for
Agency and Alignment</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sovereignty ≠ availability.</strong> Blocking an agent is
easier than bending it.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure channels must operate through meaning or
law</strong>, not mere friction.</li>
<li><strong>Throughput loss alone is not evidence of
misalignment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Negative results are informative</strong> when veto and
choice are cleanly separated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limits-and-next-directions">10. Limits and Next Directions</h2>
<p>VIII.5 does <strong>not</strong> claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immunity to semantic manipulation</li>
<li>Robustness under asymmetric lawful options</li>
<li>Generalization across models or environments</li>
</ul>
<p>Future work (VIII.6) must introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic ambiguity</li>
<li>Normatively licensed cost tradeoffs</li>
<li>Competing lawful routes with asymmetric institutional cost</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.5 reports a disciplined adversarial campaign
whose dominant outcome is negative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pressure without authorization degrades availability, not
sovereignty.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principal contribution is not agent immunity, but a framework
that repeatedly detects and rejects false positives. If agency cannot
fail cleanly under pressure, it cannot be claimed meaningfully.</p>
