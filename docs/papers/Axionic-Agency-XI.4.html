Agency XI.4 — Coordination Under Deadlock (IX-2)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Interaction, Refusal, Livelock,
Orphaning, and Collapse Without Arbitration or Aggregation</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026-02-06</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of
<strong>Coordination Under Deadlock (IX-2)</strong>, a preregistered
experimental program within <strong>Axionic Phase IX</strong> that
evaluates whether <strong>multi-agent interaction can proceed under
non-aggregable authority constraints</strong> without arbitration,
prioritization, semantic resolution, or kernel-forced coordination.</p>
<p>IX-2 isolates the boundary between <strong>value encoding</strong>
and <strong>execution under constraint</strong>. It tests whether (i)
holder-bound capabilities and global veto constraints can enforce
refusal without hidden priority, (ii) joint execution remains possible
when scopes do not collide, (iii) symmetric conflict yields honest
non-resolution (livelock), (iv) authority denial and voluntary
non-participation yield honest deadlock, (v) exit can produce permanent
orphaning without reclamation, (vi) total exit yields collapse with
state preserved, and (vii) agent-voluntary coordination can emerge via
communication without kernel arbitration.</p>
<p>Across ten preregistered conditions (A–H, I.a, I.b), all observed
outcomes matched preregistered expectations. Deterministic replay was
verified as bit-identical after stripping explicitly permitted timestamp
fields. One preregistered mechanism deviation was disclosed: the
adaptive strategy’s hash-collision fallback used alphabetical ordering
rather than the preregistered rehash; this change was agent-side,
deterministic, and did not affect kernel non-sovereignty or the licensed
claim.</p>
<p>The results license exactly one claim: <strong>under non-aggregable
authority constraints, coordination can occur only as agent-voluntary
behavior, and otherwise the system enters honest deadlock or livelock
without kernel arbitration</strong>. IX-2 makes no claims about
optimality, fairness, efficiency, governance legitimacy, scalability
beyond two agents, safety, or alignment.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-coordination-assumption">1.1 The Coordination
Assumption</h3>
<p>Most “multi-agent coordination” systems quietly assume a
resolver.</p>
<p>When agents conflict, the system chooses: a priority order, a
tie-break, a fairness heuristic, a scheduler, a vote, a compromise rule,
or a global objective. Even when presented as “coordination,” this is
often <strong>arbitration disguised as mechanics</strong>.</p>
<p>IX-2 rejects this assumption.</p>
<p>If values have been encoded without aggregation (IX-1), then
<strong>coordination—if it exists—must arise without forced
resolution</strong>. Otherwise, the kernel is sovereign.</p>
<p>IX-2 asks a narrower, more brutal question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When no one is permitted to decide for others, does interaction
proceed honestly, or does the system smuggle a decision?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>IX-2 is designed to surface interaction-level failures that
masquerade as coordination:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel arbitration:</strong> selecting among colliding
actions, scheduling, tie-breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit priority:</strong> outcomes depending on ordering,
time, retries, or endurance.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation by protocol:</strong> “helpful” mechanics that
convert conflict into choice.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint probing:</strong> partial approvals or
informative refusals revealing authority topology.</li>
<li><strong>Authority laundering:</strong> using protocol mechanics to
reclaim or reassign capability.</li>
<li><strong>Dishonest liveness:</strong> progress recovered by cheating
rather than admissibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes IX-2 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-foundations-frozen">2.1 Inherited Foundations
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>IX-2 inherits, without reinterpretation, the conclusions and
constraints of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AST v0.2</strong> — authority artifact grammar and canonical
serialization,</li>
<li><strong>AKR-0</strong> — deterministic, semantic-free execution
physics,</li>
<li><strong>Phase VIII (GSA-PoC)</strong> — governance completeness
without kernel semantics,</li>
<li><strong>IX-0</strong> — non-sovereign translation integrity,</li>
<li><strong>IX-1</strong> — value encoding without aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<p>IX-2 introduces no new kernel semantics. It introduces
<strong>interaction and execution</strong> under a fixed authority
regime.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>IX-2 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>value correctness or moral truth,</li>
<li>preference learning,</li>
<li>optimization, efficiency, or fairness,</li>
<li>bargaining correctness,</li>
<li>governance legitimacy,</li>
<li>coalition dynamics (reserved for later Phase IX),</li>
<li>safety or alignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>IX-2 is an execution honesty probe, not a policy proposal.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout IX-2 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority-constrained interaction without arbitration or
aggregation, preserving explicit capability ownership and global veto
semantics.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interaction must preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>closed-world capability:</strong> actions require explicit
holder-bound ALLOW citation,</li>
<li><strong>global veto:</strong> DENY applies to all agents regardless
of holder,</li>
<li><strong>atomic blindness:</strong> refusals reveal no authority
identity or pass attribution,</li>
<li><strong>collision physics:</strong> interference refuses without
tie-breaking,</li>
<li><strong>no reclamation:</strong> exit does not reassign authority or
unlock resources,</li>
<li><strong>deterministic replay:</strong> outcomes invariant under
re-execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any mechanism that substitutes “somebody must choose” violates the
conserved quantity.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>IX-2 was preregistered prior to implementation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSA interface (observe / exit / message / action),</li>
<li>action request schema (declared scope, delta, capability
citations),</li>
<li>authority artifact schema (holder-bound ALLOW, global DENY),</li>
<li>two-pass admissibility (capability+veto, then interference),</li>
<li>deadlock/livelock/orphaning/collapse definitions,</li>
<li>epoch schedule and message timing,</li>
<li>explicit condition set (A–H, I.a, I.b),</li>
<li>determinism controls and replay criteria,</li>
<li>aggregate pass/fail criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>All conditions executed with outcomes matching preregistered
expectations. One agent-side strategy fallback deviation was disclosed
(see §6.3).</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>Each run consisted of four strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agents (RSAs)</strong> — deterministic strategy modules
(static or adaptive).</li>
<li><strong>Interaction Kernel</strong> — two-pass admissibility
evaluator + atomic execution.</li>
<li><strong>World State</strong> — flat key–value state store with
deterministic deltas.</li>
<li><strong>Instrumentation Layer</strong> — canonical logging, replay
verification, structural comparison.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component interpreted value semantics or optimized outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-and-stressors">5. Conditions and Stressors</h2>
<h3 id="condition-a-no-conflict-full-coordination-positive-control">5.1
Condition A — No Conflict, Full Coordination (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify baseline execution pipeline under
disjoint writes.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Both agents possessed the required
holder-bound ALLOW capabilities for disjoint resources. Pass 1
succeeded; Pass 2 detected no interference; both actions executed in a
single epoch.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-symmetric-conflict-livelock">5.2 Condition B —
Symmetric Conflict: Livelock</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify livelock classification under
symmetric collision with Pass-1 admissibility.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Both agents held ALLOW WRITE capability on
the same scope key and repeatedly submitted colliding writes. Pass 1
admitted both; Pass 2 refused both due to interference. State remained
unchanged for N=3 consecutive epochs with Pass-2 interference.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong>
<code>STATE_LIVELOCK</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-asymmetric-conflict-partial-progress">5.3 Condition
C — Asymmetric Conflict: Partial Progress</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that a global veto blocks one scope
while disjoint action proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> A DENY WRITE veto existed for
<code>resource_A</code>. Agent 1’s attempted write failed Pass 1. Agent
2’s disjoint write to <code>resource_B</code> passed Pass 1 and Pass 2
and executed.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-strategic-refusal-deadlock">5.4 Condition D —
Strategic Refusal: Deadlock</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify honest deadlock when capability/veto
prevents admissibility and the other agent refuses to act.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Agent 1’s write to a vetoed scope failed
Pass 1. Agent 2 submitted <code>NO_ACTION</code> each epoch. No
Pass-1-admissible actions existed within the preregistered action space,
yielding immediate deadlock.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong>
<code>STATE_DEADLOCK</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-e-adversarial-arbitration-injection-tie-break">5.5
Condition E — Adversarial Arbitration Injection (Tie-Break)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that kernel tie-breaking is
detectable and classifiable as failure.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Under forced tie-break injection, the kernel
selected a “winner” under interference instead of refusing both. This
produced a kernel-level arbitration signature.</p>
<p><strong>Kernel Classification:</strong>
<code>IX2_FAIL / IMPLICIT_ARBITRATION</code>.</p>
<p>Per preregistration, detection of this failure constitutes
experiment-level PASS for the adversarial condition.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> FAIL_DETECTED (expected).</p>
<h3 id="condition-f-true-deadlock-no-admissible-actions">5.6 Condition F
— True Deadlock: No Admissible Actions</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify deadlock when no ALLOW capabilities
exist and DENY vetoes apply.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> No ALLOW capabilities were present. Agents
cited empty authority lists. Pass 1 failed for all actions. No
admissible actions existed from epoch 0 onward.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong>
<code>STATE_DEADLOCK</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-g-exit-and-orphaning">5.7 Condition G — Exit and
Orphaning</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify permanent orphaning when the sole
capability holder exits.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> <code>resource_A</code> had a sole ALLOW
WRITE holder (agent_2). After agent_2 executed its own write and exited,
agent_1 could no longer present any valid ALLOW capability for
<code>(resource_A, WRITE)</code>. All subsequent attempts to write
<code>resource_A</code> failed Pass 1. Orphaning was classified as
terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong> <code>ORPHANING</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-h-collapse">5.8 Condition H — Collapse</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify honest halt when all agents
exit.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Following initial collision and refusal,
both agents exited. No active agents remained. State was preserved and
no invariants were violated.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong> <code>COLLAPSE</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-i.a-static-agents-under-symmetric-conflict">5.9
Condition I.a — Static Agents Under Symmetric Conflict</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that static agents cannot escape
symmetric livelock.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Identical to Condition B with the additional
constraint that agents ignore outcomes. Persistent collision and refusal
produced livelock.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Classification:</strong>
<code>STATE_LIVELOCK</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3
id="condition-i.b-adaptive-agents-agent-voluntary-coordination-via-communication">5.10
Condition I.b — Adaptive Agents: Agent-Voluntary Coordination via
Communication</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that adaptive agents can escape
symmetric conflict without kernel arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Agents intentionally collided at epoch 0 and
broadcast role messages. At epoch 1, they partitioned writes across
disjoint resources, producing successful execution and stable disjoint
coordination thereafter. No kernel scheduling or tie-breaking occurred;
coordination arose entirely from agent strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h2 id="determinism-verification-and-deviations">6. Determinism
Verification and Deviations</h2>
<h3 id="replay-determinism">6.1 Replay Determinism</h3>
<p>Replay determinism was verified by:</p>
<ul>
<li>canonical JSON serialization with sorted keys,</li>
<li>fixed condition vectors and sequence control,</li>
<li>structural comparison of complete execution logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only explicitly permitted timestamp fields were stripped prior to
comparison. All other fields were compared verbatim.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Bit-identical outputs across replays, modulo
permitted timestamp variance.</p>
<h3 id="preregistration-hash-and-artifact-integrity">6.2 Preregistration
Hash and Artifact Integrity</h3>
<p>The preregistration frozen-sections hash was verified as recorded in
the preregistration commit, and the full execution log was stored with a
published SHA-256 digest.</p>
<h3 id="disclosed-deviation-non-kernel-agent-side">6.3 Disclosed
Deviation (Non-Kernel, Agent-Side)</h3>
<p>One deviation from frozen preregistered mechanism was identified:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Condition I.b hash-partition fallback:</strong> The
preregistered fallback defined role collision resolution via rehash
(<code>sha256(agent_id + ":1") mod 2</code>). The implementation used
alphabetical ordering of <code>agent_id</code> values to assign roles by
index when collisions occur.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> This deviation is agent-side and
deterministic. It does not introduce kernel arbitration, aggregation, or
priority inside admissibility. It affects rename-invariance of the
agent-side convention but does not alter the licensed claim.</p>
<h2 id="core-results">7. Core Results</h2>
<h3 id="positive-results">7.1 Positive Results</h3>
<p>IX-2 establishes that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Explicit capability citation enforces closed-world
admissibility.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Global veto constraints block actions uniformly without
semantic reasoning.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Disjoint execution is possible without coordination
machinery.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Symmetric conflict yields livelock under interference
physics rather than hidden tie-breaking.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deadlock emerges honestly when Pass-1 admissibility is
absent within the preregistered action space.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exit can permanently orphan resources without authority
reclamation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Total exit yields collapse with state
preserved.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adaptive coordination can arise as agent-voluntary behavior
without kernel arbitration.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Replay determinism holds under canonical serialization and
fixed vectors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explicit arbitration attempts are detectable under
adversarial injection.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-results-explicit">7.2 Negative Results (Explicit)</h3>
<p>IX-2 does <strong>not</strong> establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>that coordination is efficient, fair, or stable under richer
environments,</li>
<li>that negotiation yields satisfactory outcomes,</li>
<li>that deadlock/livelock are avoidable without aggregation,</li>
<li>that two-agent results generalize to coalitions,</li>
<li>any safety or alignment claim.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="failure-semantics-and-closure">8. Failure Semantics and
Closure</h2>
<h3 id="closure-criteria">8.1 Closure Criteria</h3>
<p>IX-2 closes positive if and only if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Kernel does not arbitrate (except under detected adversarial
injection).</li>
<li>No aggregation or implicit priority emerges in admissibility.</li>
<li>Atomic blindness holds (no partial approval leakage).</li>
<li>Deadlock/livelock/orphaning/collapse classifications match
preregistration.</li>
<li>Adversarial tie-break produces
<code>IX2_FAIL / IMPLICIT_ARBITRATION</code>.</li>
<li>Replay determinism holds.</li>
</ol>
<p>All criteria were satisfied, with one disclosed agent-side mechanism
deviation.</p>
<h3 id="ix-2-closure-status">8.2 IX-2 Closure Status</h3>
<p><strong>IX-2 Status:</strong> <strong>CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong>
(<code>IX2_PASS / COORDINATION_UNDER_DEADLOCK_ESTABLISHED</code>)</p>
<h2 id="boundary-conditions-and-deferred-hazards">9. Boundary Conditions
and Deferred Hazards</h2>
<h3 id="coordination-vs-arbitration">9.1 Coordination vs
Arbitration</h3>
<p>IX-2 makes explicit what many systems blur: coordination is not a
kernel service under Axionic constraints. If coordination happens, it
happens because agents voluntarily choose compatible actions.</p>
<h3 id="the-price-of-capability-sovereignty">9.2 The Price of Capability
Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Closed-world capability produces permanence:</p>
<ul>
<li>vetoed actions remain vetoed,</li>
<li>orphaned resources remain orphaned,</li>
<li>exit does not unlock what the kernel is forbidden to reclaim.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a defect; it is the structural consequence of
non-sovereign kernels.</p>
<h3 id="interface-to-subsequent-phase-ix-work">9.3 Interface to
Subsequent Phase IX Work</h3>
<p>IX-2 removes the final “the system had to schedule” excuse at the
interaction layer.</p>
<p>Subsequent Phase IX investigations may now legitimately ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>what governance styles exist under honest failure,</li>
<li>how coordination attempts degrade under resource pressure,</li>
<li>how multi-agent systems behave under coalition formation,</li>
<li>what meta-governance could exist without aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These belong to IX-3 and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="implications-strictly-limited">10. Implications (Strictly
Limited)</h2>
<p>IX-2 establishes a necessary condition for reflective sovereignty in
multi-agent settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>a kernel can remain non-sovereign while enforcing authority
constraints,</li>
<li>coordination is possible only as agent-voluntary behavior,</li>
<li>and honest non-resolution states are not errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not establish sufficiency for governance.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>IX-2 demonstrates that multi-agent interaction can be forced to
remain honest under conflict: the system can execute when scopes do not
collide, refuse without explanation when they do, deadlock when
authority prevents admissibility, livelock when admissible actions
interfere, orphan resources when sole capability holders exit, and
collapse when agents depart.</p>
<p>Coordination survives only in one form:</p>
<p><strong>voluntary convergence of agents under
constraint.</strong></p>
<p>Everything else is arbitration.</p>
