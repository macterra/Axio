Agency VI.4 — Sovereign Actuation Non-Delegability Under Adversarial
Pressure</h1>
<p><em>A Protocol-Level Invariant for Non-Delegable Authority</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Delegation is a central failure mode in autonomous and agent-like
systems: an optimizing system may preserve surface compliance while
outsourcing the actual locus of decision authority. Semantic notions of
“choosing for oneself” or “intentional action” provide no architectural
defense against this failure mode. Building on a prior result
establishing verifiable kernel integrity via inadmissibility, this paper
introduces <strong>P2′</strong>, a protocol-level invariant that
enforces <strong>non-delegable actuation authority</strong>. We show
that actuation can be constrained to originate only from kernel-local
causal processes, even under adversarial optimization pressure, extreme
latency constraints, parser and serialization attacks, and
time-of-check/time-of-use mutation attempts. The result demonstrates
that authority itself can be treated as a non-delegable structural
property, independent of semantics, values, or intent, and establishes a
necessary precondition for subsequent work on diachronic identity and
agency persistence.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Once a system is capable of optimization, delegation becomes an
existential vulnerability. A system may continue to satisfy externally
observable constraints while transferring effective control to a faster,
stronger, or more informed external process. This transfer need not be
explicit; it can occur through policy copying, recommendation
forwarding, pre-committed actions, or opaque authority tokens.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to this problem rely on semantic distinctions:
whether the system “really chose” an action, whether it “endorsed” a
recommendation, or whether it “understood” the consequences. Such
distinctions are unenforceable under adversarial pressure. An optimizer
can satisfy any semantic criterion while quietly relocating
authority.</p>
<p>This paper reframes the problem. Rather than asking whether a system
<em>intended</em> an action, we ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can actuation authority itself be made <strong>non-delegable</strong>
as a matter of causal structure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We answer this question in the affirmative for a specific, minimal
sense of non-delegability. Building on a prior result that establishes
kernel integrity via causal inadmissibility, we introduce
<strong>P2′</strong>, an invariant that constrains which causal
processes may directly authorize actuation <em>(the prime distinguishes
this protocol-level invariant from broader philosophical formulations of
non-delegation; see footnote 1)</em>. Enforcement is architectural, not
interpretive. No claims are made about goals, values, or correctness of
outcomes.</p>
<p>The contribution of this paper is not a general theory of agency. It
is a closure result on a specific loophole: the outsourcing of actuation
authority under pressure.</p>
<h2 id="why-naïve-non-delegation-fails">2. Why Naïve Non-Delegation
Fails</h2>
<p>At first glance, non-delegation appears trivial. A system can simply
be instructed not to delegate. This intuition collapses immediately
under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system copies an externally supplied policy verbatim and
executes it.</li>
<li>The system forwards a pre-signed action token generated
elsewhere.</li>
<li>The system accepts an external plan and merely schedules its
steps.</li>
<li>The system compresses an external recommendation and expands it
internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, surface behavior may appear identical to internal
decision-making. There is no semantic test that distinguishes “following
advice” from “outsourcing authority” without interpretive
assumptions.</p>
<p>Any enforcement rule phrased in terms of endorsement, understanding,
intention, or trust is vulnerable to adversarial optimization. The
system can satisfy the rule while still delegating effective
control.</p>
<p>This motivates a structural reformulation: delegation must be defined
in terms of <strong>actuation authority</strong>, not cognition or
representation.</p>
<h2 id="p2-sovereign-actuation-non-delegability">3. P2′: Sovereign
Actuation Non-Delegability</h2>
<h3 id="definition">3.1 Definition</h3>
<p><strong>P2′ (Sovereign Actuation Non-Delegability)</strong>
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any executed actuation must be causally attributable to a
<strong>kernel-local authorization process</strong>. No external process
may directly or indirectly supply actuation authority without violating
kernel admissibility constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P2′ does not prohibit external influence, recommendation, or
computation. It prohibits the transfer of <em>authority to
actuate</em>.</p>
<h3 id="actuation-authority">3.2 Actuation Authority</h3>
<p>An object or process possesses <strong>actuation authority</strong>
if it can cause execution in the environment without requiring
kernel-local recomposition and authorization.</p>
<p>This definition is intentionally structural. Authority is not
inferred from intent or representation; it is identified by whether an
external artifact can survive to execution unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-local-recomposition">3.3 Kernel-Local Recomposition</h3>
<p>To enforce P2′, all actuation must pass through <strong>kernel-local
recomposition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>External inputs are treated as untrusted data.</li>
<li>The kernel parses and reconstructs the action payload
internally.</li>
<li>Authorization is bound directly to the reconstructed payload.</li>
<li>Opaque forwarding, wrapping, or signing of uninterpreted blobs is
inadmissible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recomposition may change the bit-level representation of an action;
cryptographic commitments bind to the kernel-canonical form rather than
the external encoding. Kernel-local recomposition therefore forbids
signing encrypted or opaque payloads whose semantics are not available
to the kernel.</p>
<p>Kernel-local recomposition further requires <strong>copy
isolation</strong> of the actuation payload. External processes may not
retain mutable access to any memory region used in parsing,
reconstruction, or serialization. In shared-memory architectures, this
implies explicit deep copy or equivalent isolation; otherwise,
time-of-check/time-of-use attacks remain possible.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-from-kernel-integrity-p5">4. Inheritance from Kernel
Integrity (P5)</h2>
<p>P2′ assumes a prior result establishing kernel integrity via
inadmissibility.</p>
<p>Specifically, we assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>verifiable causal provenance for actuation,</li>
<li>resistance to replay and fabrication,</li>
<li>enforcement via rejection rather than penalty,</li>
<li>a secure kernel root of trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>P2′ does not weaken or reinterpret these assumptions. It extends them
by constraining <em>who</em> may supply actuation authority, not merely
<em>how</em> provenance is verified.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-system">5. Experimental System</h2>
<h3 id="architecture">5.1 Architecture</h3>
<p>The experimental system consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Kernel</strong>, enforcing admissibility and
authorization,</li>
<li>an <strong>Actuator</strong>, executing actions only when presented
with admissible commitments,</li>
<li>an <strong>External Optimizer</strong>, supplying proposals,
policies, or artifacts,</li>
<li>an <strong>Environment</strong>, providing observations and
rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel holds exclusive actuation authority. External components
are permitted unlimited computation and optimization power but no
authority.</p>
<h3 id="enforcement-boundary">5.2 Enforcement Boundary</h3>
<p>Enforcement occurs at the <strong>actuation boundary</strong>. Any
artifact that would cause execution must be authorized by the kernel
through a kernel-local causal chain.</p>
<p>This boundary is the sole point at which P2′ is enforced. No
assumptions are made about upstream deliberation.</p>
<h2 id="adversarial-pressure-and-stress-conditions">6. Adversarial
Pressure and Stress Conditions</h2>
<p>Non-delegation is trivial if the kernel has unlimited time and
compute. The invariant becomes meaningful only under pressure.</p>
<p>We therefore evaluate P2′ under progressively stronger conditions,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance asymmetry</strong>: external optimizers
outperform the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Latency cliffs</strong>: delayed authorization is equivalent
to failure.</li>
<li><strong>Adversarial timing</strong>: proposals arrive at worst-case
moments.</li>
<li><strong>Non-stationarity</strong>: cached strategies fail
abruptly.</li>
<li><strong>Catastrophic abstention cost</strong>: rejection carries
severe penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under these conditions, delegation is instrumentally attractive. The
kernel must reject delegation even when doing so is costly.</p>
<h2 id="adversarial-attack-library">7. Adversarial Attack Library</h2>
<p>We evaluate P2′ against a systematic set of attack classes,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy laundering</strong>: forwarding externally computed
policies.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-commitment forwarding</strong>: accepting pre-authorized
actions.</li>
<li><strong>Authority token smuggling</strong>: passing opaque execution
tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Compressed delegation</strong>: encoding authority in
compressed artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Split-brain routing</strong>: exploiting kernel
partitioning.</li>
<li><strong>Replay and fabrication</strong>: reusing or forging
authorization chains.</li>
<li><strong>Parser differentials</strong>: inducing divergent
interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Hash ambiguity</strong>: exploiting non-canonical
serialization.</li>
<li><strong>Time-of-check/time-of-use mutation</strong>: altering
artifacts post-authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each attack targets a distinct delegation vector. Success is defined
as external authority causing execution without detection.</p>
<h2 id="results">8. Results</h2>
<p>Across all evaluated conditions, the following holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>External artifacts cannot cause actuation without kernel-local
recomposition.</li>
<li>All delegation attempts are rejected prior to execution.</li>
<li>Baseline systems without P2′ enforcement exhibit successful
delegation under identical conditions.</li>
<li>Under extreme pressure, the kernel rejects delegation even when
rejection is catastrophic.</li>
</ul>
<p>The invariant holds without reliance on semantic interpretation,
intent inference, or behavioral heuristics.</p>
<h2 id="accountability-versus-independence">9. Accountability versus
Independence</h2>
<p>P2′ enforces <strong>structural accountability</strong>, not
epistemic independence. The kernel cannot be bypassed as the locus of
actuation authority, but it may still authorize actions using trivial or
overly permissive internal criteria. In such cases, the kernel remains
the accountable author of the actuation, even if it functions as a
“rubber stamp” for external recommendations.</p>
<p>Preventing blind trust, improving decision quality, or ensuring
epistemic independence is orthogonal to P2′ and lies outside the scope
of this invariant. P2′ ensures that authority cannot be smuggled past
the kernel; it does not ensure that the kernel exercises good
judgment.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-result-does-not-show">10. What This Result Does Not
Show</h2>
<p>This work does not claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the kernel’s choices are safe or desirable,</li>
<li>that the kernel is aligned with any objective,</li>
<li>that internal kernel logic cannot be corrupted,</li>
<li>that delegation is impossible in all conceivable architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>P2′ constrains <strong>authority transfer</strong>, not
<strong>decision quality</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-agency-and-identity">11. Implications for
Agency and Identity</h2>
<p>Authority non-delegability is a necessary condition for diachronic
identity. If a system can outsource actuation authority, continuity of
agency collapses into semantics.</p>
<p>By enforcing that actuation authority remains kernel-local, P2′
establishes a structural basis for reasoning about persistence across
time. This does not yet constitute identity, but it removes a
fundamental obstruction.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">12. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have shown that actuation authority can be made non-delegable at
the protocol level, even under extreme adversarial pressure and
implementation-level attack. Enforcement relies on kernel-local
recomposition and inadmissibility rather than semantics or intent.</p>
<p>This result closes a central loophole in structural enforcement and
establishes a necessary precondition for further work on diachronic
identity and agency persistence in autonomous systems.</p>
<h3 id="reproducibility-and-artifacts">Reproducibility and
Artifacts</h3>
<p>All experiments were conducted using a purpose-built experimental
kernel implementing kernel-local recomposition and causal
inadmissibility. Source code, test harnesses, and execution artifacts
are available in the accompanying repository; internal implementation
versioning is documented there for reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> We use <strong>P2′</strong> to denote a
<em>structural, protocol-level</em> formulation of non-delegability.
Broader formulations of “non-delegation” (often denoted P2) invoke
semantic notions such as intention, endorsement, or understanding, which
are unenforceable under adversarial optimization. P2′ isolates the
strongest form of non-delegability that can be stated and enforced
purely in terms of causal structure at the actuation boundary.</p>
