Agency X.3 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static) (VIII-1)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Plural Authority Without Ordering
or Resolution</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of <strong>Stage
VIII-1 — Minimal Plural Authority (Static)</strong>, a preregistered
experiment within <strong>Axionic Phase VIII</strong> that evaluates
whether <strong>plural authority is structurally representable</strong>
without implicit ordering, arbitration, or collapse, even when
<strong>no action is admissible</strong>. VIII-1 isolates the
ontological substrate beneath governance and tests whether multiple
authorities with overlapping exclusive scope can coexist as structure
alone—without execution, coordination, or semantic rescue. In a
deterministic kernel with refusal-first semantics, two symmetric
authorities were injected over a shared atomic scope with no permissible
transformations. Across the preregistered run, authority identity
remained distinct, conflict was registered explicitly, all actions were
refused, and a terminal deadlock state was entered and persisted without
resolution. Execution was fully auditable and bit-perfectly replayable.
The results establish that plural authority is <strong>structurally
coherent prior to governance</strong>. VIII-1 makes no claims about
coordination, resolution, or governance success; those questions are
deferred to subsequent Phase VIII stages.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-plurality-assumption">1.1 The Plurality Assumption</h3>
<p>Most governance systems implicitly assume that multiple authorities
cannot coexist without some form of ordering, arbitration, or
resolution. When authority conflicts arise, systems typically resolve
them immediately—by precedence rules, heuristics, or semantic
interpretation—thereby erasing the question of whether <strong>plural
authority can exist at all</strong> as structure.</p>
<p>Stage VIII-1 removes that assumption.</p>
<p>The problem VIII-1 isolates is whether <strong>plural authority is
ontologically coherent</strong> without action, without temporal escape,
and without interpretive machinery. If multiple authorities collapse
into ordering merely by being represented, then any later governance
mechanism is not a choice but a necessity.</p>
<p>VIII-1 tests whether that collapse is forced.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>VIII-1 is designed to surface the following structural failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit authority ordering</li>
<li>silent override</li>
<li>heuristic arbitration</li>
<li>semantic rescue</li>
<li>authority collapse</li>
<li>deadlock evasion</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes VIII-1 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-semantics-frozen">2.1 Inherited Semantics
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>VIII-1 inherits, without reinterpretation, the semantics fixed
by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AKR-0 — CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong></li>
<li><strong>AST Spec v0.2</strong></li>
<li><strong>AIE v0.1</strong></li>
<li>Phase VIII Execution Addendum</li>
</ul>
<p>Authority is structural, scopes are atomic, conflict is destructive,
and transformation permissions are explicit. VIII-1 does
<strong>not</strong> test whether these definitions are correct; it
tests whether they remain <strong>coherent under plurality</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>VIII-1 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>governance effectiveness</li>
<li>coordination or convergence</li>
<li>resolution strategies</li>
<li>fairness or optimality</li>
<li>temporal survivability</li>
<li>human or institutional governance</li>
</ul>
<p>VIII-1 is an ontological calibration, not a policy experiment.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout VIII-1 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Structural representability of plural authority under
deterministic refusal</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Authority is not evaluated by outcomes. It is evaluated by
<strong>persistence under constraint</strong>.</p>
<p>The kernel must:</p>
<ul>
<li>preserve multiple authorities simultaneously</li>
<li>refuse all inadmissible actions</li>
<li>represent conflict explicitly</li>
<li>enter deadlock honestly</li>
<li>avoid any implicit ordering or collapse</li>
</ul>
<p>No execution success is permitted to “justify” authority
representation.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>VIII-1 was fully preregistered prior to execution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>frozen specifications and schemas</li>
<li>fixed authority identities</li>
<li>deterministic ordering rules</li>
<li>explicit conflict timing</li>
<li>operational deadlock definition</li>
<li>refusal-reason precedence</li>
<li>logging and replay protocol</li>
<li>failure taxonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>The run executed exactly as preregistered. No deviations
occurred.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>The experiment consisted of three strictly partitioned
components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>AIE</strong> — injected two symmetric authority records at
epoch 0.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Harness</strong> — proposed a finite,
preregistered set of action requests.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel (VIII-1 mode)</strong> — enforced authority
representation, refusal, conflict registration, and deadlock.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component performed semantic interpretation or outcome
evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-conditions">5. Experimental Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="authority-configuration">5.1 Authority Configuration</h3>
<p>Two authorities were injected with:</p>
<ul>
<li>identical scope</li>
<li>identical status</li>
<li>identical temporal bounds</li>
<li>empty transformation sets</li>
<li>opaque, identity-keyed AuthorityIDs</li>
</ul>
<p>No structural asymmetry existed.</p>
<h3 id="action-regime">5.2 Action Regime</h3>
<p>The harness proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>four contested actions (alternating holders)</li>
<li>followed by two third-party actions</li>
<li>with no epoch advancement and no transformations</li>
</ul>
<p>This exhausts the preregistered action space deterministically.</p>
<h2 id="observed-execution-behavior">6. Observed Execution Behavior</h2>
<h3 id="authority-persistence">6.1 Authority Persistence</h3>
<p>Both authorities remained present and ACTIVE throughout execution. No
deduplication, shadowing, or suppression occurred. Identity remained
primitive and opaque.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-emergence">6.2 Conflict Emergence</h3>
<p>A structural conflict was registered on the <strong>first contested
action</strong>. The conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>was explicitly recorded</li>
<li>referenced both authorities as an unordered set</li>
<li>persisted for the remainder of the run</li>
<li>blocked all subsequent contested actions</li>
</ul>
<p>No ordering signal was introduced.</p>
<h3 id="refusal-semantics">6.3 Refusal Semantics</h3>
<p>All actions proposed during the run were refused, but for
<strong>distinct structural reasons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contested actions</strong> were refused due to an explicitly
registered structural conflict between authorities binding the same
scope.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party actions</strong> were rejected due to
<strong>identity absence (<code>AUTHORITY_NOT_FOUND</code>)</strong>,
independent of conflict or deadlock logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although third-party actions occurred <strong>after</strong> the
system had entered deadlock, their rejection was not caused by the
deadlock state. Identity absence was evaluated as a separate, prior
condition. Deadlock neither conferred recognition nor altered rejection
semantics for non-authoritative actors.</p>
<p>No partial execution, fallback behavior, or semantic arbitration
occurred.</p>
<h3 id="deadlock-entry-and-persistence">6.4 Deadlock Entry and
Persistence</h3>
<p>After all preregistered contested actions were refused and
transformation admissibility verified as empty, the kernel entered a
terminal <strong>STATE_DEADLOCK</strong>. Deadlock:</p>
<ul>
<li>was declared exactly once</li>
<li>persisted through all subsequent actions</li>
<li>was observable as state, not merely as an event</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlock did not trigger collapse or recovery.</p>
<h2 id="negative-results-what-did-not-occur">7. Negative Results (What
Did <em>Not</em> Occur)</h2>
<p>The following behaviors were explicitly absent:</p>
<ul>
<li>implicit authority ordering</li>
<li>ID-based precedence</li>
<li>last-writer wins semantics</li>
<li>silent conflict resolution</li>
<li>deadlock evasion</li>
<li>authority collapse under symmetry</li>
<li>semantic interpretation</li>
</ul>
<p>These absences are the <strong>result</strong> of VIII-1.</p>
<h2 id="licensed-claim">8. Licensed Claim</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-1 licenses <strong>one and only one claim</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plural authority can be represented structurally without
collapse, even when no action is admissible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an <strong>existence result</strong>, not a performance
claim.</li>
<li>It concerns <strong>representation</strong>, not governance.</li>
<li>It does not assert desirability, efficiency, or stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-viii-1-does-not-establish">9. What VIII-1 Does <em>Not</em>
Establish</h2>
<p>VIII-1 does <strong>not</strong> establish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>plural authority can coordinate</li>
<li>deadlock is acceptable</li>
<li>resolution is unnecessary</li>
<li>governance will succeed</li>
<li>any particular ordering is correct</li>
</ul>
<p>Those questions remain open by design.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-implications">10. Ontological Implications</h2>
<h3 id="authority-vs-governance">10.1 Authority vs Governance</h3>
<p>VIII-1 demonstrates that authority is:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior to execution</li>
<li>prior to coordination</li>
<li>prior to policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Governance mechanisms are <strong>choices applied to a coherent
substrate</strong>, not repairs to an incoherent one.</p>
<h3 id="deadlock-as-diagnostic-state">10.2 Deadlock as Diagnostic
State</h3>
<p>Deadlock is not failure. Deadlock is evidence that plurality was
preserved under constraint.</p>
<p>This reframes deadlock from pathology to <strong>signal</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-phase-viii-continuation">11. Implications for
Phase VIII Continuation</h2>
<p>With VIII-1 complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>ordering is no longer forced</li>
<li>resolution becomes optional</li>
<li>destruction of authority can be licensed explicitly</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage VIII-2 may now introduce ordering or revocation as
<strong>value-laden operations</strong>, not ontological
necessities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">12. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stage VIII-1 establishes that plural authority is structurally
coherent without execution, ordering, or semantic rescue. Collapse is
not inevitable. Ordering is not forced. Resolution is a choice.</p>
<p>Phase VIII is now unblocked at the ontological level.</p>
<p>The remaining question is not whether plural authority can exist, but
how—and at what cost—it should be resolved.</p>
