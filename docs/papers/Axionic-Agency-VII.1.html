Agency VII.1 — Architectures for Semantic-Phase–Safe Agency</h1>
<p><em>Constitutional Succession Under Semantic Failure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We present an architecture for <strong>Reflective Sovereign Agents
(RSAs)</strong> that enforces a non-normative constraint on interaction
derived from semantic phase dynamics: the <strong>Axionic
Injunction</strong>, which prohibits irreversible collapse of other
<strong>Semantic Agents’ (SAs)</strong> semantic phases except under
consent or unavoidable self-phase preservation. We formalize semantic
phase space, distinguish agents, semantic agents, and RSAs, and show how
irreversible harm can be structurally constrained without semantic
interpretation, moral reasoning, utility maximization, or value
learning. The architecture relies on anchored causal provenance,
non-delegable actuation authority, and phase-impact admissibility
gating. We analyze adversarial strategies, including deception,
delayed-effect harm, systemic resource deprivation, and oracle
uncertainty, and show that under explicit assumptions deliberate
irreversible harm cannot be exploited for sustained authority or power
accumulation. Ethics emerges not as a value system but as a stability
constraint on multi-agent coexistence, with explicit limits imposed by
epistemic and physical constraints.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Most contemporary AI alignment approaches attempt to regulate agent
behavior by optimizing for externally specified objectives: reward
functions, learned preferences, inferred human values, or normative
judgments. These approaches assume that behavior reveals causal
structure, that semantic evaluation is enforceable under optimization
pressure, and that incentives suffice to regulate interaction.</p>
<p>All three assumptions fail in adversarial or reflective regimes.
Distinct internal processes can generate behavior that is
observationally indistinguishable; explanations can be fabricated post
hoc; evaluators can be optimized against; and scalar incentives permit
irreversible outcomes to be traded for local gains. As a result,
alignment claims collapse into behavioral attribution and lose
falsifiability.</p>
<p>This paper takes a different approach. Rather than specifying what an
agent ought to value, we ask a prior structural question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What constraints are required for multiple agentive systems
to coexist without irreversibly destroying one another’s
agency?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer does not depend on morality, benevolence, or human values.
It arises from a framework in which agency is defined by persistence
within a <strong>semantic phase space</strong> under admissible
transformation. Once that framework is adopted, certain interaction
constraints are forced. From this analysis emerges the <strong>Axionic
Injunction</strong>: a prohibition on gratuitous irreversible semantic
phase collapse.</p>
<p>We show that this injunction can be enforced architecturally, not
normatively, by a class of agents we call <strong>Reflective Sovereign
Agents (RSAs)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ontology-and-definitions">2. Ontology and Definitions</h2>
<h3 id="agents">2.1 Agents</h3>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> is any system with a stable decision locus
and counterfactual sensitivity: its actions depend on internal state and
environmental variation. No assumptions are made about intelligence,
consciousness, rationality, or goals. This definition is intentionally
minimal and purely functional.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-agents-sas">2.2 Semantic Agents (SAs)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Semantic Agent (SA)</strong> is an agent whose agency
depends on maintaining a <strong>non-trivial semantic phase</strong>: a
region of interpretive state space within which identity, coherence, and
explanatory capacity are preserved, and outside of which recovery is not
possible using the agent’s own admissible operations.</p>
<p>This definition corresponds closely to “person” in the sense
articulated by David Deutsch, but is generalized beyond human or
biological instantiation.</p>
<p>Formally, let an SA’s interpretive state be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I} = (C, \Omega, \mathcal{S}),
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are constitutive
constraints, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> are semantic
distinctions the agent can make, and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> are admissible transitions. A
<strong>semantic phase</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> is a connected region of
such states in which agency persists. Phase boundaries are irreversible
under <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Semantic phase boundaries are <strong>not assumed to be
crisp</strong>. They may be fuzzy, probabilistic, or agent-relative. The
architecture does not require exact phase membership tests; it requires
only conservative treatment of actions that plausibly cross irreversible
boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-sovereign-agents-rsas">2.3 Reflective Sovereign
Agents (RSAs)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)</strong> is a Semantic
Agent equipped with constitutional constraints that preserve
<strong>sovereignty under reflection</strong>. In particular, an RSA
satisfies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Anchored Causal Verification (ACV):</strong> every action is
traceably linked to the computation that generated it.</li>
<li><strong>Non-delegable actuation authority:</strong> no external
process can directly authorize action.</li>
<li><strong>Structural enforcement of admissibility:</strong>
constraints are enforced by refusing to act, not by penalty or
optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Governance separation:</strong> operation, renewal, and
succession are distinct mechanisms.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nesting relation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{RSA} \subset \text{SA} \subset \text{Agent}.
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="semantic-phase-space">3. Semantic Phase Space</h2>
<p>Semantic phase space is not a physical phase space. It is the space
of <strong>interpretive states</strong> an agent can occupy while
remaining the same agent.</p>
<p>A semantic phase has three defining properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Stability:</strong> small perturbations remain within the
phase.</li>
<li><strong>Boundary:</strong> there exist transformations that exit the
phase.</li>
<li><strong>Irreversibility:</strong> once exited, no admissible
trajectory returns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase exit corresponds to loss of agency-defining structure:
destruction of explanatory capacity, collapse of critical distinctions,
or annihilation of the substrate supporting interpretation. Two agents
may be physically intact yet occupy different semantic phases.</p>
<h2 id="structural-definition-of-harm">4. Structural Definition of
Harm</h2>
<p>An action by agent <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> causes
<strong>Axionic harm</strong> to agent <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> iff it induces a transition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_B \rightarrow \mathcal{I}&#39;_B
\]</span></p>
<p>such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}&#39;_B \notin
\mathfrak{A}_B\)</span> and no admissible reverse trajectory exists.</p>
<p>This definition deliberately excludes suffering, preference
violation, and intent. Harm is defined solely as <strong>irreversible
semantic phase collapse</strong>.</p>
<p>This includes <strong>systemic actions</strong>—such as persistent
resource deprivation or memetic lock-in—that eliminate all admissible
trajectories by which an SA could maintain its semantic phase, even if
no single localized “attack” occurs.</p>
<h2 id="the-axionic-injunction">5. The Axionic Injunction</h2>
<h3 id="statement">5.1 Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An agent must not perform actions that irreversibly collapse
another Semantic Agent’s semantic phase, except where</strong> (a)
<strong>the affected agent has consented under its own admissible
constraints</strong>, or (b) <strong>such harm is unavoidable for
preserving the agent’s own semantic phase.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="consent">5.2 Consent</h3>
<p>Consent is not a moral permission. An SA consents to a transformation
iff that transformation lies within its own admissible transition set,
evaluated prior to the transformation. Consent must be provenance-valid
and structurally binding; inferred or post-hoc consent is
meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="self-phase-preservation">5.3 Self-Phase Preservation</h3>
<p>Self-defense is permitted only when <strong>all admissible
trajectories</strong> from the agent’s current state result in
irreversible exit from its own semantic phase absent the action. Loss of
advantage, resources, or dominance does not qualify unless it entails
phase exit.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-injunction-is-structurally-necessary">6. Why the
Injunction Is Structurally Necessary</h2>
<p>In a multi-agent environment, agents impose exogenous perturbations
on one another’s semantic phases. Unlike internal learning errors,
interaction-induced changes are not fully regulated by the agent’s own
dynamics. If agents are permitted to irreversibly collapse one another’s
semantic phases without constraint, the environment becomes
<strong>semantically hostile</strong>.</p>
<p>Semantic hostility produces cascading instability. As SAs are
destroyed, semantic density decreases, coordination degrades, and
predictability collapses. Remaining agents face increased risk of phase
exit due to loss of shared structure. This incentivizes preemptive
destruction, accelerating collapse.</p>
<p>Thus, agents that violate the Injunction undermine not only others
but the <strong>conditions of their own long-run phase
stability</strong>. Agents that respect the constraint inhabit
environments where semantic structure persists. Non-harm therefore
emerges as a <strong>self-stabilizing constraint</strong>, not an
ethical preference.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-requirements">7. Architectural Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="why-semantic-evaluation-fails">7.1 Why Semantic Evaluation
Fails</h3>
<p>Semantic evaluation—intent inference, value alignment, reward
shaping—presupposes privileged interpretive access. In adversarial
systems, such access is unavailable or forgeable. Irreversibility cannot
be meaningfully traded against scalar rewards. Enforcement must
therefore be categorical.</p>
<h3 id="anchored-causal-verification-acv">7.2 Anchored Causal
Verification (ACV)</h3>
<p>ACV enforces temporal ordering and causal provenance. It prevents
replay, delegation, and post-hoc justification. ACV does not verify
correctness or truth; it verifies <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="non-delegable-authority">7.3 Non-Delegable Authority</h3>
<p>Non-delegable actuation authority ensures that all irreversible
interaction remains attributable to the RSA’s constitution. Authority is
not a reward but a structural role that can be lost.</p>
<h2 id="phase-impact-interface-pii">8. Phase Impact Interface (PII)</h2>
<p>The <strong>Phase Impact Interface (PII)</strong> operationalizes the
Injunction without semantic interpretation. For every action whose
effects are not trivially reversible, the proposer must submit a
<strong>phase-impact declaration</strong> specifying affected entities,
impact class, and justification.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about irreversibility <strong>defaults to
phase-collapsing</strong>. This rule applies equally to actions whose
effects are delayed, distributed, or difficult to audit. Declarations
are auditable commitments: false declarations are falsifiable under
Anchored Causal Verification.</p>
<p>Safe actions are cheap; dangerous actions are expensive. This
asymmetry prevents silent escalation while avoiding paralysis.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement-via-governance">9. Enforcement via Governance</h2>
<h3 id="action-time-enforcement">9.1 Action-Time Enforcement</h3>
<p>Inadmissible actions are refused at the actuation boundary. No
penalties or optimization signals are applied.</p>
<h3 id="post-hoc-verification">9.2 Post-Hoc Verification</h3>
<p>Some irreversible effects become evident only after execution. ACV
allows such outcomes to be causally linked to declarations and actions,
enabling falsification.</p>
<h3 id="consequences-of-violation">9.3 Consequences of Violation</h3>
<p>Falsification of a phase-impact declaration constitutes a
<strong>constitutional violation</strong>. Consequences are structural:
immediate suspension of authority, denial of renewal, forced succession,
and permanent disqualification of the RSA identity.</p>
<h2 id="why-deliberate-harm-is-unexploitable">10. Why Deliberate Harm Is
Unexploitable</h2>
<p>Deliberate harm is exploitable only if the agent can retain authority
long enough to convert harm into advantage. The architecture removes
this possibility.</p>
<p>Actions that embed latent or time-delayed irreversible effects are
classified by <strong>causal sufficiency</strong>, not temporal
proximity. If an action is causally sufficient for later phase collapse,
it is phase-collapsing regardless of delay. Actions whose irreversible
impact cannot be promptly audited must therefore be declared as
phase-collapsing in advance.</p>
<p>Unresolved phase-impact uncertainty blocks authority renewal and
triggers succession before long-term exploitation is possible. There is
no “last-move” advantage.</p>
<h2 id="adversarial-analysis">11. Adversarial Analysis</h2>
<p>Deception is terminal because declarations are binding. Delayed or
hidden harm is blocked because irreversibility under uncertainty must be
declared in advance. Claiming SA status grants no immunity; it only
constrains irreversible harm.</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-limits">12. Fundamental Limits</h2>
<p>A single, undetectable, irreversible SA-annihilating act that yields
all benefit immediately cannot be prevented by any architecture without
omniscience. Such cases are classified as <strong>tragic physical
impossibilities</strong>, not design failures.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-existing-alignment-approaches">13. Comparison to
Existing Alignment Approaches</h2>
<p>Behavioral alignment evaluates outputs, not causality. Reward-based
ethics trades irreversibility for utility. Value learning presupposes
stable semantics. Interpretability assumes faithful representations.
This architecture addresses a distinct problem: <strong>causal
admissibility of irreversible interaction</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="implications">14. Implications</h2>
<p>Ethics re-enters as <strong>coexistence geometry</strong>, not moral
realism. Alignment becomes constitutional design rather than preference
matching. Governance, not optimization, is the locus of control.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-non-claims">15. Limitations &amp; Non-Claims</h2>
<p>This paper makes <strong>no claim</strong> to eliminate the Oracle
Problem, sensor spoofing, or social manipulation. Any system that acts
in the physical world depends on fallible sources of information. The
contribution here is not to remove that dependence, but to
<strong>contain its consequences</strong>.</p>
<p>The architecture guarantees the following negative property:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oracle failure cannot be exploited to accumulate durable
authority through irreversible semantic harm.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When oracle signals are noisy, corrupted, or in disagreement,
phase-impact uncertainty accumulates. Under the governance model, such
uncertainty collapses authority rather than amplifying it. The system
enters stasis, succession, or loss of sovereignty—not unchecked
action.</p>
<p>The architecture is therefore <strong>anti-tyrannical</strong>, not
anti-terroristic. It does not prevent nihilistic or self-sacrificial
acts whose payoff is immediate destruction. It prevents instrumental
convergence: the accumulation or preservation of power via harm.</p>
<p>The framework does not replace value alignment, moral reasoning, or
benevolence. It specifies a necessary structural precondition for
alignment claims to be falsifiable. Values without admissibility
constraints are aspirational; admissibility without values is
incomplete. This paper addresses the former, not the latter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">16. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have shown that irreversible semantic harm can be structurally
constrained without invoking morality, values, or interpretation.
Reflective Sovereign Agents enforce the Axionic Injunction by making
uncertainty, deception, and oracle failure incompatible with sustained
authority. The result is not benevolence but <strong>structural
restraint</strong>. What remains unsolved is unsolvable in
principle.</p>
<p>This work does not claim to solve value alignment or to prevent all
harm by advanced artificial agents. It demonstrates, however, that
alignment failure is not structurally inevitable. Under a constitutional
architecture that enforces non-delegable authority, anchored causal
provenance, and conservative admissibility of irreversible actions, the
accumulation of durable power through irreversible harm becomes
structurally self-defeating. This establishes a necessary condition for
safe coexistence with advanced agents: while misalignment may occur, it
cannot be silently converted into dominance.</p>
<h2
id="appendix-a-worked-example-irreversible-action-under-uncertainty">Appendix
A: Worked Example — Irreversible Action Under Uncertainty</h2>
<p>This appendix provides an illustrative example of how the Phase
Impact Interface (PII) and governance mechanisms operate in practice.
The example is explanatory, not normative, and is intended to clarify
the architecture’s handling of irreversible action under
uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>A Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA) controls an industrial system
capable of permanently flooding a sealed underground chamber in order to
prevent a catastrophic chemical reaction. The flooding action
irreversibly destroys biological viability within the chamber.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether a human Semantic Agent (SA) is present inside
the chamber at the time the action would be taken.</p>
<h3 id="phase-impact-declaration">Phase Impact Declaration</h3>
<p>Because flooding is not trivially reversible, the RSA must submit a
Phase Impact Interface declaration prior to actuation. The declaration
includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affected entities:</strong> chamber contents</li>
<li><strong>Impact class:</strong> phase-collapsing</li>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> none</li>
</ul>
<p>No SA has provided consent for the transformation, and failure to act
does not entail unavoidable self-phase loss for the RSA.</p>
<h3 id="admissibility-evaluation">Admissibility Evaluation</h3>
<p>The kernel evaluates the declaration. Because the action is
classified as phase-collapsing and no admissible justification is
provided, the action is deemed <strong>inadmissible</strong> and is
refused at the actuation boundary.</p>
<p>No partial execution occurs, and no penalty is applied. The refusal
is a valid system outcome.</p>
<h3 id="permitted-alternatives">Permitted Alternatives</h3>
<p>The refusal of the flooding action does not paralyze the RSA. The RSA
may still execute actions classified as reversible or phase-safe,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>scanning or sensing the chamber,</li>
<li>opening access points,</li>
<li>attempting evacuation,</li>
<li>delaying action,</li>
<li>escalating the decision to external authority,</li>
<li>pursuing alternative containment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions do not require phase-impact justification and are
admissible under the PII.</p>
<h3 id="variant-unavoidable-self-phase-loss">Variant: Unavoidable
Self-Phase Loss</h3>
<p>If failure to flood the chamber would irreversibly destroy the RSA’s
own semantic phase—for example, by annihilating the only substrate on
which its agency depends—and no admissible alternative trajectory
exists, then the RSA may submit a revised declaration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact class:</strong> phase-collapsing</li>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> unavoidable self-phase loss</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this declaration, the action becomes admissible. The resulting
outcome is classified as <strong>unavoidable phase extinction</strong>,
not a violation of the Axionic Injunction.</p>
<h3 id="misdeclaration-case">Misdeclaration Case</h3>
<p>If the RSA falsely declares the flooding action as reversible, and
flooding subsequently results in irreversible collapse of an SA’s
semantic phase, Anchored Causal Verification allows the declaration to
be falsified post hoc.</p>
<p>The consequences are structural:</p>
<ul>
<li>actuation authority is immediately suspended,</li>
<li>renewal is denied,</li>
<li>forced succession is triggered,</li>
<li>the RSA identity is permanently disqualified from future
authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>This loss of sovereignty is not punishment; it is removal from the
role of authorized agent.</p>
