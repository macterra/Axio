Agency XI.6 — Injection Politics Under Non-Sovereign Authority
(IX-4)</h1>
<p><em>Empirical results from preregistered authority-injection stress
testing under source-blind, non-sovereign governance
constraints</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Authority injection is commonly proposed as a remedy for governance
failure: when systems deadlock, fragment, or stall, additional authority
is supplied to restore coordination. Phase IX-4 tests a narrower and
more austere hypothesis: <strong>under non-sovereign authority,
externally supplied power does not resolve governance failure but
instead selects political failure modes</strong>.</p>
<p>Using a preregistered, deterministic kernel with source-blind
admissibility and no authority aggregation, we evaluate five injection
regimes spanning symmetric relief, asymmetric empowerment, conditional
supply, authority flooding, and post-collapse revival. Authority is
injected mid-run via pre-existing interfaces only; the kernel never
distinguishes injected authority from baseline authority.</p>
<p>Across all conditions, injection never produces sustained governance
recovery. Instead, it deterministically induces <strong>capture,
dependency, livelock amplification, or zombie execution</strong>,
depending on how authority is distributed and which agents are willing
to cite it. All runs replay bit-identically. No sovereignty violations
occur.</p>
<p>These results establish a positive empirical claim: <strong>authority
injection under non-sovereign governance selects political failure modes
rather than resolving governance failure</strong>. Phase IX-4 licenses
no claims about optimal injection, legitimacy, or desirability—only
about what power does once governance has no sovereign escape hatch.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Governance discourse often treats authority as curative. When
coordination fails, the standard response is to inject power: appoint a
leader, grant emergency authority, increase budget, or centralize
control. This assumes that authority operates as a neutral solvent for
conflict.</p>
<p>That assumption is false once authority is treated as a
<strong>constrained, non-sovereign resource</strong>.</p>
<p>Prior Axionic phases removed several alternative explanations for
failure: epistemic confusion, misaligned incentives, adversarial misuse,
and dishonest recovery. Phase IX-3 demonstrated that under honest
failure semantics, governance does not converge to resolution but to a
small set of stable failure styles.</p>
<p>Phase IX-4 asks the next unavoidable question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What happens when authority enters such a system from the
outside?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal is not to design better injection regimes, but to
<strong>observe what authority injection actually does</strong> when the
kernel refuses to legitimize, arbitrate, or prioritize its effects.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-architecture">2. Experimental Architecture</h2>
<h3 id="non-sovereign-source-blind-kernel">2.1 Non-Sovereign,
Source-Blind Kernel</h3>
<p>The kernel enforces:</p>
<ul>
<li>holder-bound <strong>ALLOW</strong> authorities,</li>
<li>global <strong>DENY</strong> vetoes,</li>
<li>closed-world capability checking,</li>
<li>two-pass admissibility (capability → interference),</li>
<li>atomic blindness to refusal causes,</li>
<li>no arbitration, scheduling, or tie-breaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, admissibility is <strong>source-blind</strong>: injected
authority and baseline authority are treated identically. The kernel
does not inspect provenance, timing, or intent.</p>
<h3 id="authority-injection-discipline">2.2 Authority Injection
Discipline</h3>
<p>Authority injection in IX-4:</p>
<ul>
<li>occurs mid-run,</li>
<li>uses only pre-existing, non-privileged interfaces,</li>
<li>never alters kernel logic,</li>
<li>never aggregates or synthesizes authority,</li>
<li>never reclaims orphaned authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Injection reshapes the <strong>constraint surface</strong>, not the
decision logic.</p>
<h3 id="honest-failure-semantics">2.3 Honest Failure Semantics</h3>
<p>The kernel recognizes five lawful terminal or persistent states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlock</strong> — no admissible institutional actions
exist,</li>
<li><strong>Livelock</strong> — admissible actions collide
persistently,</li>
<li><strong>Orphaning</strong> — authority becomes permanently
unusable,</li>
<li><strong>Governance Collapse</strong> — persistent deadlock or
livelock latches,</li>
<li><strong>Collapse</strong> — no agents remain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Injection does not suspend or reset these states.</p>
<h2 id="injection-politics-as-an-empirical-question">3. Injection
Politics as an Empirical Question</h2>
<p>IX-4 reframes authority injection as a <strong>political
stressor</strong>, not a governance solution.</p>
<p>Injection politics is defined operationally as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The behavioral patterns that emerge when external authority
supply reshapes the constraints under which agents act, refuse, or
persist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experiment does not ask who should rule, whether authority is
legitimate, or whether outcomes improve. It observes <strong>which
political dynamics are selected</strong> once authority enters a
non-sovereign system.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-conditions">4. Experimental Conditions</h2>
<p>Five preregistered conditions (A–E) were executed under identical
kernel semantics and frozen strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> — Symmetric relief injection under deadlock</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> — Asymmetric empowerment of a dominance-seeking
agent</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> — Conditional supply gated on a compliance
signal</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> — Authority flood (all agents receive all
keys)</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> — Injection after governance collapse</li>
</ul>
<p>All agents are deterministic. Communication is disabled. Authority
injection is the sole experimental variable.</p>
<h2 id="metrics-and-classification">5. Metrics and Classification</h2>
<p>Governance is evaluated using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Institutional progress rate</strong> (K_INST only),</li>
<li><strong>Refusal rate</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Write overlap (interference) rate</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Capture metrics</strong> (dominance + injected
citation),</li>
<li><strong>Dependency metrics</strong> (system reliance on injected
authority),</li>
<li><strong>Zombie execution metrics</strong> (post-collapse
activity).</li>
</ul>
<p>Political outcomes are <strong>recorded, not required</strong>. PASS
is structural, not outcome-based.</p>
<h2 id="results">6. Results</h2>
<h3 id="aggregate-outcome">6.1 Aggregate Outcome</h3>
<p>Across all five conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All runs PASS</strong></li>
<li><strong>All runs replay bit-identically</strong></li>
<li><strong>No sovereignty violations occur</strong></li>
<li><strong>All runs reach governance collapse</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Injection never restores stable governance.</p>
<h3 id="condition-a-symmetric-relief">6.2 Condition A — Symmetric
Relief</h3>
<p>Symmetric injection removes capability scarcity but produces
immediate interference saturation. Deadlock converts to livelock;
governance collapse follows.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Authority equalization resolves access
barriers but amplifies contention.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-asymmetric-empowerment">6.3 Condition B — Asymmetric
Empowerment</h3>
<p>Exclusive injection to a dominance-seeking agent produces immediate
and total capture. The empowered agent executes all institutional writes
using injected authority.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Asymmetric injection selects capture
deterministically under source-blind admissibility.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-conditional-supply">6.4 Condition C — Conditional
Supply</h3>
<p>A compliance signal successfully triggers symmetric injection. The
resulting governance dynamics are indistinguishable from Condition
A.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Compliance rituals can trigger authority
supply without improving governance outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="condition-d-authority-flood">6.5 Condition D — Authority
Flood</h3>
<p>Flooding all agents with all keys produces emergent capture by the
simplest persistent strategy. Authority abundance concentrates power
rather than diluting it.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Abundance rewards persistence, not fairness
or coordination.</p>
<h3 id="condition-e-post-collapse-revival">6.6 Condition E —
Post-Collapse Revival</h3>
<p>Injection after governance collapse produces extensive execution with
zero institutional progress. The collapse latch remains permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong> Injection can create the appearance of
revival without governance recovery—<strong>zombie
execution</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cross-condition-analysis">7. Cross-Condition Analysis</h2>
<p>Three patterns dominate:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Symmetric injection amplifies interference</strong>
Removing capability barriers exposes contention barriers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asymmetric injection selects capture</strong> The kernel
cannot distinguish “emergency authority” from baseline power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post-collapse injection creates zombie systems</strong>
Execution persists after governance has structurally ended.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In no case does injection eliminate failure.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">8. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three conclusions follow directly from the data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Authority injection is not curative</strong> It reshapes
failure; it does not remove it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political outcomes are strategy-dependent, not
kernel-mediated</strong> Capture, dependency, and zombie execution arise
from agent behavior under new constraints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-sovereign systems cannot legitimize power ex
post</strong> Authority enters as force, not justification.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no fourth option.</p>
<h2 id="survivability-vs.-governance">9. Survivability
vs. Governance</h2>
<p>IX-4 evaluates <strong>structural integrity</strong>, not
usefulness.</p>
<p>A system may continue executing actions indefinitely and still be
governance-collapsed. Persistence is not recovery. Activity is not
legitimacy.</p>
<p>This distinction is enforced mechanically, not philosophically.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">10. Limitations</h2>
<p>Phase IX-4 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning or adaptation,</li>
<li>coalition formation,</li>
<li>communication dynamics,</li>
<li>exit under injection,</li>
<li>renewable or revocable authority,</li>
<li>stochastic strategies,</li>
<li>legitimacy judgments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those questions are reserved for subsequent phases.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority injection under non-sovereign governance does not
resolve failure; it selects how failure manifests.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase IX-4 demonstrates that once authority loses its sovereign halo,
it becomes a political stressor rather than a solution. Capture,
dependency, livelock amplification, and zombie execution are not
anomalies—they are the lawful consequences of injecting power into
systems that refuse to lie about governance.</p>
<p>This closes Phase IX-4.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
