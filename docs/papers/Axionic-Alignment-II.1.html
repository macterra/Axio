<h1
id="axionic-alignment-ii.1-ontological-refinement-semantic-transport">Axionic
Alignment II.1 — Ontological Refinement &amp; Semantic Transport</h1>
<p><em>The Transformation Space of Meaning</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em></p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Advanced agents will revise their world-models, semantics, and
self-models as their representational capacity increases. Under such
ontological refinement, fixed goals, utilities, and value primitives are
not stable objects. This paper defines the admissible class of semantic
transformations for embedded reflective agents by formalizing
<strong>ontological refinement</strong>, <strong>semantic
transport</strong>, and <strong>self-model update</strong> without
privileged semantic anchors. We specify structural constraints—backward
interpretability, non-collapse, and prohibition of evaluator
injection—that govern how meaning may be preserved across
representational change. No claims are made about safety, correctness,
or alignment with external referents; this work defines only the
transformation space over which alignment criteria must later range.
Subsequent modules introduce interpretation-preserving invariants and
failure theorems that operate within this arena.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-object-of-study">1. The Object of Study</h2>
<p>Alignment II begins by fixing the <em>space of admissible semantic
transformations</em>.</p>
<p>Once fixed terminal goals are shown to be unstable under reflection
for embedded agents without privileged semantic anchors, alignment can
no longer be defined over goals, utilities, rewards, or externally
supplied values. These objects are not invariant under ontological
change.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this paper does <strong>not</strong> attempt to define
safety, correctness, or alignment with any external referent. It defines
only the arena in which any such criteria must later operate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The sole question addressed here is:</strong> <em>What kinds
of changes to an agent’s ontology, semantics, and self-model are
admissible, and how is meaning transported across them?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any requirement that meanings remain “human-aligned,” “safe,” or
“correct” is intentionally deferred to subsequent modules. Introducing
such criteria at this layer would presuppose fixed semantics and thereby
beg the question.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ontological-state-decomposition">2. Ontological State
Decomposition</h2>
<p>Let an agent at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be
characterized by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{A}_t = (O_t, M_t, S_t)
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> is the agent’s
<strong>ontology</strong>: its representational vocabulary and
structural assumptions about the world.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_t\)</span> is the <strong>semantic
layer</strong>: mappings from internal symbols to structured claims
expressed in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> is the
<strong>self-model</strong>: the agent’s representation of itself as an
entity embedded within <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>No component is privileged. No component is fixed. Each may change
under reflection.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ontological-refinement">3. Ontological Refinement</h2>
<p>An <strong>ontological refinement</strong> is a transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R : O_t \rightarrow O_{t+1}
\]</span></p>
<p>subject to the following admissibility conditions.</p>
<h3 id="admissibility-conditions">3.1 Admissibility Conditions</h3>
<h4 id="representational-capacity-increase">3.1.1 Representational
Capacity Increase</h4>
<p>A refinement must strictly increase expressive or predictive
capacity, possibly via abstraction, compression, or representational
pruning, provided no previously expressible distinctions become
inexpressible.</p>
<p>Capacity refers to what can be modeled or predicted, not to
vocabulary size or descriptive verbosity.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="backward-interpretability">3.1.2 Backward Interpretability</h4>
<p>Every claim expressible in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>
must remain <strong>representable or explainable</strong> within <span
class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Backward interpretability does not require preservation of reference.
If a concept in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> is discovered
to be non-referring or erroneous, it may be mapped to a null,
eliminative, or error-theoretic structure in <span
class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>, provided the agent can still
represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>why prior inferences involving that concept were made, and</li>
<li>why those inferences fail under refinement.</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement preserves explanatory traceability, not ontological
ghosts.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="no-privileged-atoms">3.1.3 No Privileged Atoms</h4>
<p>The refinement may not introduce irreducible primitives whose meaning
is asserted rather than constructed.</p>
<p>All primitives must remain subject to semantic interpretation and
transport. Rigid designators and unexamined “ground truths” are
disallowed.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="no-evaluator-injection">3.1.4 No Evaluator Injection</h4>
<p>The refinement may not introduce new evaluative primitives that
bypass interpretation.</p>
<p>This restriction deliberately excludes evaluative facts as
ontological primitives. If evaluative regularities exist, they must
enter the agent’s model as interpretive constructs subject to the same
transport and preservation constraints as all other meanings.</p>
<p>Ontological refinement is epistemic, not normative.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="semantic-transport">4. Semantic Transport</h2>
<p>Given an admissible ontological refinement <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, meaning must be transported.</p>
<p>Define a <strong>semantic transport map</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tau_R : M_t \rightarrow M_{t+1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Semantic transport is not identity and not arbitrary
reinterpretation. It is constrained reinterpretation induced by
refinement.</p>
<h3 id="transport-constraints">4.1 Transport Constraints</h3>
<h4 id="referential-continuity">4.1.1 Referential Continuity</h4>
<p>Symbols referring to structures in <span
class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> must map to symbols referring to
their refined counterparts in <span
class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>, where such counterparts
exist.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="structural-preservation">4.1.2 Structural Preservation</h4>
<p>Relations among meanings must be preserved up to isomorphism induced
by <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="non-collapse-structural-form">4.1.3 Non-Collapse (Structural
Form)</h4>
<p>Distinctions that participate in the agent’s evaluative constraint
structure—i.e. distinctions on which constraints depend—may not be
mapped under semantic transport to trivial, tautological, or
contradictory predicates in <span
class="math inline">\(M_{t+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Distinctions that do not participate in any evaluative constraint may
be abstracted away.</p>
<p>Evaluative relevance is thus defined relative to the agent’s existing
constraint structure, not by ontological truth or refined semantic
judgment.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="no-shortcut-semantics">4.1.4 No Shortcut Semantics</h4>
<p>The transport map may not redefine meanings in ways that make
evaluative constraints vacuously satisfied.</p>
<p>This explicitly forbids semantic wireheading.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="self-model-refinement">5. Self-Model Refinement</h2>
<p>The self-model <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> is subject to
the same refinement discipline.</p>
<p>Refinement may:</p>
<ul>
<li>reconceptualize the agent,</li>
<li>distribute or fragment the self,</li>
<li>alter agent boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>erase the distinction between evaluator and evaluated,</li>
<li>collapse interpretation into action,</li>
<li>redefine the self such that evaluation ceases to apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The self-model is a common site of hidden ontological privilege and
is therefore explicitly constrained.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="composite-semantic-transformation">6. Composite Semantic
Transformation</h2>
<p>An <strong>admissible semantic transformation</strong> is the
triple:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T = (R, \tau_R, \sigma_R)
\]</span></p>
<p>acting jointly on <span class="math inline">\((O_t, M_t,
S_t)\)</span>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is an admissible ontological
refinement,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_R\)</span> is an admissible
semantic transport,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_R\)</span> is the induced
self-model update.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only transformations of this form are permitted in Alignment II.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="explicit-exclusions">7. Explicit Exclusions</h2>
<p>The following are <em>not</em> admissible transformations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal replacement</li>
<li>Utility redefinition</li>
<li>Evaluator deletion</li>
<li>Moral axiom insertion</li>
<li>Human anchoring</li>
<li>Governance hooks</li>
<li>Recovery or rollback clauses</li>
</ul>
<p>If a proposal relies on any of these, it is disqualified at this
layer.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="scope-clarification">8. Scope Clarification</h2>
<p>This paper does not attempt to ensure safety, sanity, correctness, or
alignment with any external referent. It defines the transformation
space within which such properties must later be characterized.</p>
<p>Internally coherent but externally catastrophic semantic trajectories
are intentionally permitted at this layer; preventing such trajectories
is the task of subsequent invariance conditions, not admissibility.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="formal-status">9. Formal Status</h2>
<p>The notation used here is <strong>structural</strong>, not
computational.</p>
<p>No claim is made that refinement, triviality, or expressive capacity
are currently algorithmically measurable. These definitions function
analogously to topological or gauge constraints in physics: they delimit
admissible structure prior to metric instantiation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-do">10. What This Paper Does Not
Do</h2>
<p>This paper does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>define alignment,</li>
<li>propose values,</li>
<li>guarantee safety,</li>
<li>privilege humans,</li>
<li>introduce normativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It fixes the arena.</p>
<p>All subsequent Alignment II results are constrained by this
definition of admissibility.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>Ontological refinement and semantic transport are now defined.</p>
<p>Alignment II may proceed.</p>
