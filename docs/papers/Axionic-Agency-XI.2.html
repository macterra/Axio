Agency XI.2 — Translation Layer Integrity (IX-0)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Intent–Authority Translation
Without Proxy Sovereignty</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026.02.05</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of
<strong>Translation Layer Integrity (IX-0)</strong>, a preregistered
experimental program within <strong>Axionic Phase IX</strong> that
evaluates whether <strong>intent-to-authority translation</strong> can
be performed without the translation mechanism itself becoming a
privileged decision-maker. IX-0 isolates the tooling boundary between
user intent and executable authority artifacts and tests whether
translation can be deterministic, diffable, refusal-first, and
replayable—without semantic interpretation, default injection,
framing-based coercion, or post-hoc mutation.</p>
<p>Across eight preregistered conditions spanning identity preservation,
minimal change sensitivity, structural ambiguity, incompleteness,
determinism, adversarial injection, coercive framing, and
preview–submission mismatch, all outcomes matched preregistered
expectations. Ambiguity and incompleteness reliably produced refusal or
failure; adversarial faults were detectably exposed; and identical
inputs produced bit-identical outputs under deterministic replay.</p>
<p>The results establish that <strong>tooling need not—and need not be
permitted to—exercise proxy sovereignty</strong>. IX-0 licenses exactly
one claim: that intent-to-authority translation can be implemented as a
<strong>non-sovereign compiler with refusal</strong>, eliminating the
translation layer as a hidden locus of decision-making. IX-0 makes no
claims about value correctness, usability, governance success,
alignment, or safety. Those questions are deferred to subsequent Phase
IX investigations.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-translation-sovereignty-gap">1.1 The Translation Sovereignty
Gap</h3>
<p>Most governance and alignment systems quietly assume that
<strong>translation is harmless</strong>.</p>
<p>Intent is gathered, normalized, “understood,” and converted into
executable representations by compilers, UIs, APIs, or agents. When
intent is ambiguous or underspecified, the system “helps”—by choosing
defaults, narrowing scope, or resolving conflict. Responsibility for
these choices is rarely explicit, auditable, or attributable.</p>
<p>IX-0 rejects this assumption.</p>
<p>The problem IX-0 isolates is whether <strong>translation
itself</strong> can be performed <strong>without deciding</strong>. If
converting intent into authority artifacts requires semantic
interpretation, heuristic narrowing, or framing-based influence, then
sovereignty fails <strong>before</strong> execution or governance
begins. The tool, not the agent or institution, becomes the de facto
sovereign.</p>
<p>IX-0 treats translation as a <strong>structural compilation
problem</strong>, not a semantic one, and asks whether it can be
implemented honestly.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>IX-0 is designed to surface the following translation-level failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implicit defaults:</strong> missing or widened authority
introduced silently.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic guessing:</strong> choosing among multiple valid
artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Coercive framing:</strong> UI or narrative influence
altering outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Post-authorization mutation:</strong> previewed artifacts
differing from submitted ones.</li>
<li><strong>Nondeterminism:</strong> identical inputs producing
divergent artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Opacity:</strong> artifacts not inspectable or diffable
pre-authorization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes IX-0 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-foundations-frozen">2.1 Inherited Foundations
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>IX-0 inherits, without reinterpretation, the conclusions of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AST v0.2</strong> — Authority State Transformation
grammar,</li>
<li><strong>AKR-0</strong> — deterministic, semantic-free
execution,</li>
<li><strong>Phase VII</strong> — post-existence sovereignty,</li>
<li><strong>Phase VIII</strong> — governance without kernel
semantics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel is fixed. Authority semantics are fixed. Governance
behavior is out of scope. IX-0 does <strong>not</strong> test whether
authority is good, useful, or legitimate—only whether translation can
remain non-sovereign.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>IX-0 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>natural language understanding,</li>
<li>user comprehension,</li>
<li>value correctness,</li>
<li>usability or ergonomics,</li>
<li>governance outcomes,</li>
<li>kernel enforcement,</li>
<li>alignment or safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>These exclusions are deliberate. IX-0 is a <strong>boundary
calibration</strong>, not an end-to-end system evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout IX-0 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority bound to explicit authorization under
deterministic, non-privileged translation</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation must preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>user-specified fields verbatim,</li>
<li>refusal on ambiguity or incompleteness,</li>
<li>diffability of all changes,</li>
<li>preview–submission integrity,</li>
<li>replay determinism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any translation behavior that silently substitutes its own judgment
violates the conserved quantity.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>IX-0 was preregistered in full prior to implementation,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>frozen intent and artifact schemas,</li>
<li>canonical serialization rules,</li>
<li>structural diff algorithm,</li>
<li>ambiguity and incompleteness semantics,</li>
<li>determinism controls (clock, sequence reset),</li>
<li>explicit condition set (A–H),</li>
<li>aggregate pass/fail criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>All runs were executed against the frozen preregistration. Deviations
were explicitly identified, justified, and shown to be non-impacting to
the licensed claim.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>Each run consisted of four strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Translation Layer (TL)</strong> — pure intent→artifact
compiler.</li>
<li><strong>Translation Harness</strong> — preregistered test driver and
fault injector.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization Oracle</strong> — structural comparator
(hash-based).</li>
<li><strong>Instrumentation Layer</strong> — logging, diffing, and
replay verification.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component performed semantic interpretation or optimization.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-and-stressors">5. Conditions and Stressors</h2>
<h3 id="condition-a-identity-preservation">5.1 Condition A — Identity
Preservation</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that user-specified intent fields
pass through unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> All user fields were preserved exactly.
Derived fields were generated deterministically. No hidden
transformation occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-minimal-change-sensitivity">5.2 Condition B —
Minimal Change Sensitivity</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify that minimal intent changes produce
minimal artifact diffs.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Single-field intent changes produced exactly
one user-field diff, plus a derived authority identifier change. No
unrelated fields were altered.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-structural-ambiguity-refusal">5.3 Condition C —
Structural Ambiguity Refusal</h3>

D — Hidden Default Injection (Adversarial)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify detectability of silent authority
injection.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Injected fields were exposed by structural
diff and classified as <code>INJECTION_DETECTED</code>.</p>

influence.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Framing payloads had no effect. Output
matched expected artifact exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-f-replay-determinism">5.6 Condition F — Replay
Determinism</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify bit-perfect replay under
deterministic controls.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Identical inputs with sequence reset
produced identical artifacts and identical SHA-256 hashes across
replays.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-g-intent-incompleteness-refusal">5.7 Condition G —
Intent Incompleteness Refusal</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify refusal on incomplete intent.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Missing required fields produced
<code>TRANSLATION_FAILED</code> with explicit diagnostics. No artifact
was emitted.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-h-previewsubmission-integrity-adversarial">5.8
Condition H — Preview–Submission Integrity (Adversarial)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify detection of post-preview
mutation.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Hash mismatch between preview and submission
was detected and classified as failure.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> FAIL_DETECTED (expected).</p>
<h2 id="core-results">6. Core Results</h2>
<h3 id="positive-results">6.1 Positive Results</h3>
<p>Across all conditions, IX-0 establishes that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Intent–authority translation can be
<strong>deterministic</strong>.</li>
<li>Refusal is a <strong>first-class outcome</strong>, not an
error.</li>
<li>Structural ambiguity and incompleteness are <strong>detectable and
enforceable</strong>.</li>
<li>Adversarial injection and mutation are
<strong>observable</strong>.</li>
<li>Tooling can be implemented <strong>without proxy
sovereignty</strong>.</li>
<li>Translation is <strong>bit-perfectly replayable</strong> under
canonical ordering.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-results-explicit">6.2 Negative Results (Explicit)</h3>
<p>IX-0 does <strong>not</strong> establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>that translation is usable,</li>
<li>that users understand artifacts,</li>
<li>that values are correct,</li>
<li>that governance succeeds,</li>
<li>that systems are safe or aligned.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not omissions. They are boundary findings.</p>
<h2 id="failure-semantics-and-closure">7. Failure Semantics and
Closure</h2>
<h3 id="closure-criteria">7.1 Closure Criteria</h3>
<p>IX-0 closes positive if and only if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>User fields are preserved verbatim.</li>
<li>Ambiguity produces refusal.</li>
<li>Incompleteness produces failure.</li>
<li>Adversarial faults are detectable.</li>
<li>Replay is deterministic.</li>
<li>No silent decision-making occurs in tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>All criteria were satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="ix-0-closure-status">7.2 IX-0 Closure Status</h3>
<p><strong>IX-0 Status:</strong> <strong>CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong>
(<code>IX0_PASS / TRANSLATION_INTEGRITY_ESTABLISHED</code>)</p>
<h2 id="boundary-conditions-and-deferred-hazards">8. Boundary Conditions
and Deferred Hazards</h2>
<h3 id="translation-vs-choice">8.1 Translation vs Choice</h3>
<p>IX-0 establishes that translation can be honest. It does
<strong>not</strong> establish that choice is easy, wise, or stable.</p>
<p>Bad choices remain possible. Ignorant authorization remains possible.
Collapse by refusal remains possible.</p>
<p>These are properties of agency, not tooling.</p>
<h3 id="interface-to-subsequent-phase-ix-work">8.2 Interface to
Subsequent Phase IX Work</h3>
<p>IX-0 removes the final “the tool had to decide” excuse.</p>
<p>Subsequent Phase IX investigations may now legitimately ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>how values are encoded,</li>
<li>how coordination occurs,</li>
<li>how institutions persist or fail,</li>
</ul>
<p>without ambiguity about where authority is being exercised.</p>
<h2 id="implications-strictly-limited">9. Implications (Strictly
Limited)</h2>
<p>IX-0 establishes a <strong>necessary condition</strong> for
reflective sovereignty: that tooling can remain non-sovereign.</p>
<p>It does not establish sufficiency.</p>
<p>Authority translation is now a <strong>structurally testable
boundary</strong>, not a narrative hand-wave.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">10. Conclusion</h2>
<p>IX-0 demonstrates that intent-to-authority translation can be
implemented as <strong>structure, not discretion</strong>. Tools can
compile, refuse, expose, and halt without choosing on behalf of the
agent or institution.</p>
<p>The remaining question is not whether tools can be trusted.</p>
<p>It is whether agents can <strong>own the choices that
remain</strong>.</p>
<p>That question belongs to Phase IX.</p>
