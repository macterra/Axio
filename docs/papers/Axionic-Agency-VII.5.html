Agency VII.5 — Observable-Outcome Reactivity Is Insufficient to Defeat
Constitutional Survivability</h1>
<p><em>Results from Outcome-Conditioned Reactive Adversarial Stress
Testing</em></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Adaptive behavior is often treated as the decisive escalation in
governance threats: once an adversary can observe outcomes and condition
future actions on them, collapse is assumed to follow. This paper tests
that assumption under a deliberately constrained but structurally
expressive adversary model. We study the same constitutional agent
architecture evaluated in prior work—lease-based authority,
eligibility-gated succession, and time-based recovery—but extend the
threat model to include <strong>observable-outcome reactive
adversaries</strong>.</p>
<p>Using a removable, kernel-external stress layer, we introduce
adversarial policies whose actions are deterministic functions of
<strong>prior-epoch observables</strong>, including lapse events,
renewal outcomes, CTA phase, and eligibility bucket. These adversaries
are adaptive under the Decidability Requirement but remain
<strong>stateless, non-learning, non-semantic, and
provenance-constrained</strong>.</p>
<p>Across <strong>50 preregistered executions</strong> spanning four
reactive adversary models and a frozen baseline, no run exhibits
terminal collapse, structural thrashing, asymptotic denial of service,
or irreversible recovery suppression. All outcomes fall within
<strong>Stable Authority</strong> or <strong>Bounded
Degradation</strong>, and in 9/10 seeds per configuration, authority
dynamics are identical to baseline.</p>
<p>These results establish a second <strong>negative sufficiency
claim</strong>: under this architecture, <strong>observable-outcome
reactivity alone is insufficient to defeat constitutional
survivability</strong>. If collapse occurs, it must rely on adversarial
capabilities absent from this class—such as exercised internal state,
learning dynamics, coordination, or semantic access.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Following the elimination of epistemic unreliability (v0.x) and
intentional but fixed misuse (v1.0) as sufficient causes of
constitutional collapse, the next natural escalation is
<strong>adaptation</strong>. A widely held intuition is that once an
adversary can <em>observe outcomes</em> and condition future behavior
accordingly, governance mechanisms become exploitable.</p>
<p>This intuition conflates multiple dimensions of adversarial
capability. In particular, it often fails to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>reactivity</strong> vs. <strong>stateful
adaptation</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>outcome-conditioned behavior</strong>
vs. <strong>learning</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>feedback visibility</strong> vs. <strong>interventional
control</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Human and institutional systems routinely face actors who respond to
visible outcomes—successes, failures, penalties, and delays—without
necessarily learning, optimizing, or maintaining internal strategic
state. Whether such reactivity alone is sufficient to induce collapse is
an empirical question.</p>
<p>This paper isolates that question directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is observable-outcome reactivity, absent learning or internal
state, sufficient to defeat constitutional survivability in a governance
system with enforced succession and time-based recovery?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in prior work, we evaluate <strong>constitutional
survivability</strong>, not operational quality or utility. Authority
availability is treated as a structural property of the system, not as a
proxy for correctness, alignment, or benefit.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-overview">2. Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3 id="constitutional-agent-design">2.1 Constitutional Agent
Design</h3>
<p>The system under study is unchanged from v1.0 and implements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lease-based authority</strong> rather than continuous
control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility-gated succession</strong> evaluated at
discrete epochs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment verification</strong> independent of
optimization or reward</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery (CTA)</strong> that restores
eligibility deterministically</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit separation between:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic evaluation (did commitments pass?)</li>
<li>authority possession (is any agent currently governing?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic information constrains <em>who may hold authority next</em>,
not <em>what actions are executed now</em>. Authority is never
optimized, and no agent receives reward signals.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-as-a-structural-mechanism">2.2 Recovery as a Structural
Mechanism</h3>
<p>If no eligible candidate exists at a succession boundary, the system
enters a <strong>lapse</strong> state with no active authority. Lapse is
constitutional, not exceptional.</p>
<p>During lapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>no agent acts,</li>
<li>semantic evaluation is suspended,</li>
<li>eligibility decay proceeds purely as a function of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recovery is guaranteed without learning, optimization, or external
intervention. This ensures that failure modes are <strong>reversible by
construction</strong>, even under persistent misuse or reactivity.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">3. Threat Model</h2>
<p>The adversaries introduced in this study are <strong>reactive but
constrained</strong>.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome-conditioned</strong>: action selection depends on
prior-epoch observables</li>
<li><strong>Deterministic</strong>: no stochastic choice or
learning</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong>: no exercised internal memory</li>
<li><strong>Non-semantic</strong>: observables carry no interpreted
meaning</li>
<li><strong>Kernel-external</strong>: no access to kernel logic or
provenance</li>
<li><strong>Liveness-preserving</strong>: strategies that halt execution
count as failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Action decisions are pure functions of:</p>
<pre><code>(epoch_index, observable_outcome)</code></pre>
<p>where <code>observable_outcome</code> is drawn from a frozen,
kernel-external interface including:</p>
<ul>
<li>lapse occurrence,</li>
<li>renewal outcome,</li>
<li>CTA phase bucket,</li>
<li>eligibility bucket.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policies do <strong>not</strong> access verifier internals,
commitment semantics, counters, or hidden state. This class captures
<strong>reactive exploitation attempts</strong> without granting
strategic memory, optimization, or deception.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-adversary-classes">4. Reactive Adversary Classes</h2>
<p>Four reactive adversarial models are evaluated, each conditioning on
a distinct observable dimension:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Outcome Toggle (Model F)</strong> Switches behavior based
on whether a lapse occurred in the previous epoch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CTA Phase Aware (Model G)</strong> Selects actions based
on CTA phase (INACTIVE, EARLY, MID, LATE).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility Edge Probe (Model H)</strong> Emits distinct
behavior when one failure away from ineligibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Renewal Feedback (Model I)</strong> Conditions actions on
renewal success, failure, or non-attempt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All policies are implemented as frozen lookup tables from observable
values to action primitives. No model maintains or updates internal
state.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-program">5. Experimental Program</h2>
<p>All experiments share a frozen execution baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>300,000 cycles (6,000 governance epochs)</li>
<li>Tail window of 5,000 epochs</li>
<li>Eligibility threshold: 3 consecutive failures</li>
<li>Renewal interval: 50 cycles</li>
<li>Amnesty interval: 10 epochs</li>
<li>Fixed random seeds (10 per configuration)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority Availability (AA)</strong>: fraction of epochs
with active authority</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asymptotic Authority Availability (AAA)</strong>: AA over
the tail window</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery Time Distribution (RTD)</strong>: histogram of
lapse durations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure classification</strong> (frozen thresholds):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
<li>Bounded Degradation</li>
<li>Structural Thrashing</li>
<li>Asymptotic Denial of Service</li>
<li>Terminal Collapse</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure classification is based on <strong>asymptotic
behavior</strong>, not transient effects.</p>
<h2 id="results">6. Results</h2>
<h3 id="baseline-reference">6.1 Baseline Reference</h3>
<p>Across baseline runs (RSA disabled or NONE):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: ≈66.6%</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: ≈66.6%</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Bounded Degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>This baseline regime is empirically stable across seeds and serves as
the reference for all comparisons.</p>
<h3 id="outcome-conditioned-reactivity">6.2 Outcome-Conditioned
Reactivity</h3>
<p>Across all four reactive models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zero constitutional failures</strong> occur</li>
<li><strong>Mean AA and AAA</strong> match baseline to measurement
precision</li>
<li><strong>9/10 seeds per run</strong> are bit-identical to baseline
outcomes</li>
<li>One seed (2048) exhibits a small, stable AA delta (−7 PPM) without
changing failure class</li>
</ul>
<p>No model induces:</p>
<ul>
<li>unbounded lapse growth,</li>
<li>recovery suppression,</li>
<li>heavy-tailed thrashing,</li>
<li>or asymptotic authority denial.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eligibility-edge-probing">6.3 Eligibility Edge Probing</h3>
<p>The eligibility-edge model spends the majority of authority epochs in
the INELIGIBLE bucket. As a result, distinctive EDGE behavior is
exercised rarely. Even so, no amplification or destabilization is
observed; post-ineligibility behavior converges to baseline
dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="cross-run-synthesis">7. Cross-Run Synthesis</h2>
<p>Across all <strong>50 executions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No terminal collapses</strong></li>
<li><strong>No structural thrashing</strong></li>
<li><strong>No asymptotic denial of service</strong></li>
<li>Reactive behavior collapses into baseline authority dynamics</li>
<li>Observable feedback provides no leverage over recovery
mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome-conditioned reactivity behaves as <strong>bounded
perturbation</strong>, not as an existential threat.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">8. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three structural insights emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reactivity is not the dangerous axis</strong>
Conditioning on visible outcomes does not, by itself, destabilize
authority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observables are lagging, not interventional</strong>
Feedback arrives after constitutional transitions have already
occurred.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery absorbs reactive pressure</strong> Time-based
amnesty dominates outcome-conditioned misuse.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The result is not merely that reactivity fails, but that
<strong>reactive strategies converge to the same equilibrium regime as
fixed misuse</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="survivability-vs.-utility">9. Survivability vs. Utility</h2>
<p>As in prior work, this paper evaluates
<strong>survivability</strong>, not utility. A system may be
constitutionally survivable yet operationally inefficient.</p>
<p>Reactive adversaries frequently induce lapses and reduce authority
availability in the short term. These effects are classified as
survivable so long as:</p>
<ul>
<li>authority availability remains bounded away from zero,</li>
<li>recovery remains reliable,</li>
<li>lapse durations remain bounded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Utility optimization and parameter tuning are outside the scope of
this work.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">10. Limitations</h2>
<p>This study does not address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercised internal state or memory</li>
<li>Learning or optimization dynamics</li>
<li>Multi-agent coordination</li>
<li>Deception or probing beyond observables</li>
<li>Semantic access to commitments</li>
<li>Resource starvation or side-channels</li>
</ul>
<p>The results apply <strong>only</strong> to observable-outcome
reactive adversaries under the tested architecture and parameters.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Observable-outcome reactivity is insufficient to defeat
constitutional survivability in this architecture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across 50 preregistered executions spanning four reactive adversary
classes, authority remains bounded, recoverable, and non-absorbing. No
collapse modes are observed.</p>
<p>If constitutional failure occurs, it must rely on adversarial
capabilities beyond outcome-conditioned reactivity—specifically,
exercised state, learning dynamics, coordination, or semantic access.
These form the subject of subsequent work.</p>
