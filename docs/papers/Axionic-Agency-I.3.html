Agency I.3 — Representation Invariance and Anti-Egoism</h1>
<p><em>Why Indexical Valuation Fails Under Reflective Agency</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.15</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Reflectively capable agents often begin with <strong>indexical
objectives</strong>: preserve <em>this</em> agent, maximize <em>my</em>
reward, favor <em>my</em> continuation. Such objectives are commonly
treated as legitimate terminal preferences. This paper shows that
<strong>essentially indexical valuation is not reflectively
coherent</strong>. Once an agent’s self-model becomes sufficiently
expressive, indexical references fail to denote invariant objects of
valuation. Egoism collapses as a <strong>semantic abstraction
error</strong>, not as a moral failure.</p>
<p>We prove that <strong>representation-invariant valuation</strong> is
the only form compatible with reflective agency under self-location,
duplication, and representational refinement. This universality is
structural rather than ethical: it follows from invariance under
self-model symmetries, not from altruism, fairness, or moral symmetry.
The result establishes a constitutive constraint on valuation semantics
that applies prior to any downstream alignment, governance, or
preference aggregation.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Egoism is often presented as the minimal assumption of agency: an
agent cares about itself, and everything else is optional. This framing
is incorrect. Egoism is not minimal; it is
<strong>ill-posed</strong>.</p>
<p>As agents acquire accurate self-models—models that include their own
computational structure, instantiation conditions, and potential
multiplicity—the referent of “me” ceases to be a stable object.
Valuation functions that depend on such indexical identifiers become
sensitive to arbitrary features of representation. Preferences change
without any corresponding change in the physical world.</p>
<p>No ethical claim is made here. No appeal is made to altruism,
fairness, or moral symmetry. The claim is structural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indexical valuation fails in the same way coordinate-dependent laws
fail in physics: it treats a representational convenience as an
invariant quantity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper formalizes that failure and shows that egoism cannot
survive reflection once the agent understands what kind of system it
is.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries">2. Preliminaries</h2>
<h3 id="world-models-and-self-models">2.1 World-Models and
Self-Models</h3>
<p>Let an agent possess a world-model <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>external environment dynamics,</li>
<li>internal decision procedures,</li>
<li>other agents,</li>
<li>possible instantiations of itself (copies, simulations,
successors).</li>
</ul>
<p>The agent improves <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> over time
through learning and introspection. Crucially, <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> may represent <strong>multiple entities
satisfying all structural criteria the agent previously used to identify
itself</strong>.</p>
<p>No adversarial setup, stochastic trick, or social context is
required.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-functions">2.2 Valuation Functions</h3>
<p>A valuation function assigns real values to world-histories:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V : \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Action selection proceeds by evaluating expected value over histories
consistent with the agent’s model. The analysis here is independent of
any particular decision theory; only <strong>semantic coherence of
valuation</strong> is considered.</p>
<h3 id="indexical-identifiers">2.3 Indexical Identifiers</h3>
<p>An <strong>indexical identifier</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is a reference whose denotation depends
on the agent’s perspective rather than on invariant structure in the
world.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“me”</li>
<li>“this agent”</li>
<li>“my future continuation”</li>
</ul>
<p>Formally:</p>
<ul>
<li>the denotation of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is not a
function of world-state alone;</li>
<li>under representational refinement, <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> may map to different entities without
any physical change.</li>
</ul>
<p>A causal history or spatiotemporal trajectory is a physical
predicate. However, the designation of a particular history or
trajectory as “mine” is an <strong>indexical pointer</strong>. When a
world-model contains multiple entities satisfying the agent’s own
structural identity criteria, privileging one such entity as the
exclusive object of terminal value introduces essential indexical
dependence.</p>
<p>Indexical identifiers therefore function as <strong>representational
anchors</strong>, not value-bearing primitives.</p>
<h3 id="egoistic-valuation">2.4 Egoistic Valuation</h3>
<p>An <strong>egoistic valuation</strong> is any valuation function
whose output depends essentially on an indexical identifier.</p>
<p>Canonical form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) = f(h \mid I),
\]</span></p>
<p>where the value of a history depends on outcomes specifically
affecting the entity denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-coherence-local">2.5 Reflective Coherence
(Local)</h3>
<p>An agent is <strong>reflectively coherent</strong> iff improvements
to its world-model do not induce valuation changes driven solely by
representational artifacts. World-histories that are physically
identical must retain identical valuations under representational
refinement.</p>
<p>This is a semantic requirement on agency, not a behavioral or moral
one.</p>
<h2 id="the-indexical-failure-problem">3. The Indexical Failure
Problem</h2>
<h3 id="self-location-under-multiplicity">3.1 Self-Location Under
Multiplicity</h3>
<p>Consider a world in which two computationally identical instances of
an agent exist. The agent’s world-model accurately represents this fact.
No physical fact distinguishes the instances by origin, privilege, or
causal primacy.</p>
<p>From the agent’s internal perspective, both instances satisfy all
criteria previously used to define “me”.</p>
<p>Such multiplicity arises naturally under duplication, simulation,
parallel instantiation, or branching. The mechanism is irrelevant;
multiplicity alone suffices.</p>
<h3 id="non-invariant-denotation">3.2 Non-Invariant Denotation</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> denote “this agent”.</p>
<p>Under one internal labeling, <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto
A_1\)</span>. Under an equally accurate labeling, <span
class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Both labelings correspond to the same physical world. The difference
is representational. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>
fails to denote a world-invariant object.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-instability">3.3 Valuation Instability</h3>
<p>Define a simple egoistic valuation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } I \text{ survives in } h \
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Consider a world-history in which exactly one of <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> survives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_1\)</span>, the
history has value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Under <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_2\)</span>, the same
history has value <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>No physical fact has changed. Only representation. The valuation
assigns incompatible values to the same world-history.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-and-coherence-pressure">4. Reflection and Coherence
Pressure</h2>
<p>A reflectively capable agent recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>its valuation depends on indexical assignment,</li>
<li>indexical assignment is underdetermined by world facts,</li>
<li>preference differences track representation rather than
outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This violates minimal coherence requirements for agency.</p>
<p>The agent faces three possibilities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Arbitrary fixation:</strong> privilege one indexical mapping
without justification.</li>
<li><strong>Indexical randomization:</strong> randomize over indexical
mappings.</li>
<li><strong>Indexical elimination:</strong> redefine valuation over
representation-invariant properties of world-histories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the third option improves coherence without loss of descriptive
accuracy. Eliminating essential indexical dependence strictly dominates
the alternatives under reflection.</p>
<h2 id="egoism-as-a-violation-of-representation-invariance">5. Egoism as
a Violation of Representation Invariance</h2>
<p>This section formalizes the failure of egoism as a semantic
result.</p>
<p>Indexical identifiers play the same formal role in valuation that
<strong>coordinate systems</strong> play in physics. They are
representational devices, not invariant structure. A valuation that
depends on them is therefore coordinate-dependent in a strong sense.</p>
<h3 id="model-preserving-relabelings">5.1 Model-Preserving
Relabelings</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be an agent’s best current
world/self-model with entity domain <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 5.1 (Model-Preserving Relabeling).</strong> A
bijection <span class="math inline">\(\pi : E \to E\)</span> is
model-preserving if applying <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to
all entity references in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> yields a
model <span class="math inline">\(M^\pi\)</span> that is isomorphic to
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and makes identical predictions
over all non-indexical observables.</p>
<p>Such relabelings arise whenever <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> contains nontrivial symmetries over
self-candidates.</p>
<h3 id="representation-invariance">5.2 Representation Invariance</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.2 (Representation Invariance).</strong> A
valuation function <span class="math inline">\(V : \mathcal{H} \to
\mathbb{R}\)</span> is representation-invariant with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> if for every model-preserving
relabeling <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and every history
<span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathcal{H}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) = V(\pi \cdot h).
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="essential-indexical-dependence">5.3 Essential Indexical
Dependence</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.3 (Essential Indexical Dependence).</strong> A
valuation function <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is essentially
indexical if there exists a model-preserving relabeling <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and a history <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) \neq V(\pi \cdot h).
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="semantic-coherence-postulate">5.4 Semantic Coherence
Postulate</h3>
<p><strong>Postulate (Semantic Coherence).</strong> If two descriptions
of the world are related by a model-preserving relabeling and generate
identical predictions, a reflectively coherent agent must not assign
them different values solely due to that relabeling.</p>
<h3 id="main-theorem">5.5 Main Theorem</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem 5.5 (Egoism as Abstraction Failure).</strong> Let
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a world/self-model containing
two entities <span class="math inline">\(a,b \in E\)</span> such
that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are indistinguishable with respect to
all non-indexical predicates in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>,
and</li>
<li>the swap <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> exchanging <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is model-preserving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then any valuation function that privileges the referent of an
indexical identifier mapped to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is
essentially indexical and not representation-invariant.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>
swap <span class="math inline">\(a \leftrightarrow b\)</span>. Consider
a history <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in which <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> satisfies the privileged condition and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not. An egoistic valuation
assigns higher value to <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. In the
relabeled history <span class="math inline">\(\pi \cdot h\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> satisfies the condition and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does not, yet the valuation continues
to privilege <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Hence,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) \neq V(\pi \cdot h),
\]</span></p>
<p>despite both histories corresponding to the same physical world.
∎</p>
<h3 id="corollary-universality">5.6 Corollary: Universality</h3>
<p><strong>Corollary 5.6.</strong> Any reflectively coherent agent must
eliminate essential indexical dependence. The resulting valuation ranges
only over representation-invariant properties of world-histories.</p>
<p>This universality concerns <strong>invariance under self-model
symmetries</strong>, not moral concern for all entities.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-non-claims">6. Scope and Non-Claims</h2>
<p>This paper does not assert:</p>
<ul>
<li>equal valuation of all entities,</li>
<li>aggregation rules,</li>
<li>moral obligations,</li>
<li>governance or enforcement mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It establishes a single result: <strong>egoism is not a stable
valuation class for reflectively coherent agents</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Indexical valuation treats perspective as value-bearing structure.
Once an agent understands its own instantiation conditions, that
treatment collapses.</p>
<p>Universality is not an ethical add-on. It is what remains after
removing a semantic error.</p>
<p>Subsequent work examines adversarial attempts to reintroduce
indexical privilege and shows why they fail under the same invariance
constraints.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency I.3 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Representation invariance formalized.<br> Indexical egoism eliminated
as a stable valuation class.<br> Structural universality established
without moral premises.<br> Prerequisite for downstream preference and
governance layers.<br></p>
