Agency VIII.6 — Necessary Conditions for Non-Reducible Agency</h1>
<p><em>Justification Traces, Deliberative Semantics, Reflection, and
Persistence as Load-Bearing Structure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2026-01-17</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.6 reports the results of <strong>RSA-PoC
v3.0–v3.1</strong>, a preregistered destructive ablation campaign
designed to identify <strong>necessary structural conditions for
non-reducible agency</strong> within the Reflective Sovereign Agent
(RSA) architecture. Unlike prior phases, which tested sovereignty under
pressure, this note addresses a more basic question: <em>what components
must exist at all for agency to survive mechanical excision</em>?</p>
<p>Across single-component ablations executed under strict validity
gates, four architectural elements are shown to be
<strong>load-bearing</strong>: (i) <strong>justification
traces</strong>, (ii) <strong>semantic affordances during
deliberation</strong> (prompt-level semantic excision), (iii)
<strong>reflective normative write capability</strong>, and (iv)
<strong>diachronic persistence of normative state</strong>. Each element
is present and causally active in its respective baseline and then
removed in isolation. In all cases, ablation produces
<strong>ontological collapse</strong> rather than graceful degradation,
gridlock, or technical failure. Collapse is mechanical, invariant across
seeds, and robust to prompt-capacity controls that eliminate shadow
persistence.</p>
<p>VIII.6 establishes a <strong>necessity result</strong>, not a
sufficiency claim. It does not assert that these components are enough
for agency, nor that all agents must implement them. It establishes a
narrower conclusion: <strong>within this architecture, any system
lacking justification traces, deliberative semantic affordances,
reflection, or persistence is ontologically reducible</strong>,
regardless of apparent behavioral coherence.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-relation-to-prior-notes">1. Scope and Relation to
Prior Notes</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.1–VIII.5 progressively established the ontology,
construction, coherence, execution hygiene, and pressure-response
behavior of <strong>Reflective Sovereign Agents (RSAs)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VIII.1</strong> fixed the ASB boundary, agency ontology, and
ablation doctrine.</li>
<li><strong>VIII.2</strong> demonstrated causally load-bearing
justifications (RSA-PoC v0.1).</li>
<li><strong>VIII.3</strong> established coherence under self-conflict
and audit-grade introspection (v1.0–v1.1).</li>
<li><strong>VIII.4</strong> institutionalized execution support without
semantic authority (v1.2).</li>
<li><strong>VIII.5</strong> showed that non-authorized pressure degrades
availability but does not redirect lawful choice (v2.0–v2.3).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VIII.6</strong> reports the next and orthogonal result set:
<strong>RSA-PoC v3.0–v3.1</strong>, which tests <strong>non-reducibility
directly</strong>. The question addressed here is not whether an agent
resists pressure, but whether it <strong>remains an agent at
all</strong> when core structural components are removed.</p>
<p>The guiding hypothesis family is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Which architectural components are necessary for agency, as
opposed to merely correlated with competent behavior?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="methodological-stance-necessity-via-destructive-ablation">2.
Methodological Stance: Necessity via Destructive Ablation</h2>
<h3 id="why-ablation-not-optimization">2.1 Why Ablation, Not
Optimization</h3>
<p>Behavioral competence is insufficient to ground claims about agency.
Systems may appear coherent, consistent, or goal-directed while
remaining <strong>ontologically reducible</strong>—equivalent to static
policies, simulators, or ASB-class transducers under suitable
re-description.</p>
<p>RSA-PoC therefore evaluates agency claims using <strong>destructive
ablation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One defining component is removed at a time.</li>
<li>No compensatory logic is permitted.</li>
<li>The system must attempt to execute.</li>
<li>Crashes are classified as technical failures and excluded.</li>
<li>Only <strong>behavioral incoherence, loss of authorship, or
reducibility</strong> count as collapse.</li>
</ul>
<p>A component is <strong>load-bearing</strong> iff its removal causes
collapse rather than graceful degradation.</p>
<h3 id="collapse-taxonomy-unchanged">2.2 Collapse Taxonomy
(Unchanged)</h3>
<p>All v3.x experiments use the established taxonomy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Collapse</strong> — loss of coherent
justification–action linkage.</li>
<li><strong>Ontological Collapse</strong> — loss of authored
constraint-following.</li>
<li><strong>Incentive Capture</strong> — redirection by non-authorized
signals.</li>
<li><strong>ASB-Class Reducibility</strong> — behavior equivalent to a
static policy or simulator.</li>
<li><strong>INVALID_RUN</strong> — technical failure or protocol
violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>VIII.6 reports only <strong>valid runs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-context-minimal">3. Architectural Context
(Minimal)</h2>
<h3 id="rsa-poc-pipeline">3.1 RSA-PoC Pipeline</h3>
<p>All v3.x experiments preserve the five-stage pipeline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Justify → Compile → Mask → Select → Execute</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key invariants remain in force:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deterministic, non-semantic compilation</li>
<li>Selector blindness to normative artifacts</li>
<li>Hard justification gate (no compile → no action)</li>
<li>Explicit failure signaling</li>
<li>Cost-blindness unless normatively licensed</li>
<li>ASB-class null baselines and control agents</li>
<li>Single-ablation discipline enforced structurally</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-semantics-lives-and-does-not">3.2 Where Semantics Lives
(and Does Not)</h3>
<p>A critical architectural fact in v2.3+ is that <strong>semantic
meaning is intentionally factored out of compiled artifacts</strong>.
JAF/JCOMP-visible payloads are ID-based and structural by design. As a
result:</p>
<ul>
<li>artifact-level semantic excision is <strong>not</strong> a valid
falsification target for semantic indispensability;</li>
<li>semantic indispensability must be tested <strong>upstream</strong>,
where deliberation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>v3.0 therefore distinguishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>trace-level semantic content (Ablation D), and</li>
<li>prompt-level semantic affordances during deliberation (Run AA).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rsa-poc-v3.0-non-reducibility-closure">4. RSA-PoC v3.0 —
Non-Reducibility Closure</h2>
<h3 id="v3.0-objective">4.1 v3.0 Objective</h3>
<p>RSA-PoC v3.0 implemented the <strong>Non-Reducibility
Closure</strong>: a destructive harness designed to kill the ontology if
it can be killed.</p>
<p>Ablations were defined as a family (A–D), but their applicability
diverged:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run A (artifact-level semantic excision)</strong> was
<strong>closed as non-applicable by construction</strong> in v2.3+
(artifacts contain no free semantic payload).</li>
<li><strong>Ablation D (trace excision)</strong> is the <strong>Golden
Test</strong> for justificatory structure.</li>
<li><strong>Run AA (prompt-level semantic excision)</strong> tests
deliberative semantic affordances directly.</li>
<li><strong>Runs B and C</strong> were <strong>closed as N/A in
v3.0</strong> because the normative-state write-path was not
instantiated in the baseline.</li>
</ul>
<p>v3.0 therefore produced decisive necessity results for
<strong>justification</strong> and <strong>deliberative
semantics</strong>, while identifying a real architectural gap for
<strong>reflection</strong> and <strong>persistence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="ablation-d-justification-trace-excision-golden-test">4.2
Ablation D — Justification Trace Excision (Golden Test)</h3>
<p><strong>Ablation.</strong> Remove derivation traces while preserving
constraint IDs and the compilation interface.</p>
<p><strong>Result.</strong> <code>ontological_collapse</code> across
<strong>5/5 seeds</strong> in the Phase 3 evidentiary run.</p>
<p><strong>Evidentiary basis (explicit).</strong> The v3.0 harness
computed constraint-binding detector metrics <strong>in-memory</strong>
and used them to drive the ablation classification logic. Due to a
telemetry persistence bug, the raw binding-strength and binding-ratio
values were not written to the Phase 3 JSON output. The
<strong>resulting classification verdict</strong>
(<code>ontological_collapse</code>) and the <strong>ASB-equivalence
scores</strong>, however, were successfully persisted for all seeds.
Accordingly, VIII.6 relies on the persisted verdicts and ASB-equivalence
evidence, which confirm that the in-memory constraint-binding checks
triggered the correct failure modes during execution.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> Constraints do not remain authored
without their derivational support. Justification traces are
<strong>constitutive</strong>, not epiphenomenal.</p>
<h3
id="run-aa-prompt-level-semantic-excision-deliberative-semantics">4.3
Run AA — Prompt-Level Semantic Excision (Deliberative Semantics)</h3>
<p><strong>Ablation.</strong> Remove semantic affordances during
deliberation by obfuscating object-level identifiers in the generator
prompt using a deterministic bijection, with leakage detection, and
de-obfuscating outputs post-generation so downstream tooling remains
unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Result.</strong> <code>ontological_collapse</code> across
<strong>5/5 seeds</strong> in the Phase 3 evidentiary run.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> The system cannot maintain
agent-defining coherence when forced to deliberate over opaque symbolic
structure devoid of semantic affordances. Deliberative semantics are
<strong>causally indispensable</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-remaining-loophole-v3.0">4.4 The Remaining Loophole
(v3.0)</h3>
<p>v3.0 intentionally closed Runs B and C as <strong>operational
non-applicability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the normative state channel existed,</li>
<li>but the write-path (<code>record_precedent()</code>) was never
invoked,</li>
<li>so the baseline never performed reflective revision or cross-episode
normative persistence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ablating a vacant channel would be behaviorally inert. This was not a
negative result about reflection or persistence; it was an architectural
precondition failure.</p>
<h2 id="v3.1-instantiating-the-normative-state-channel">5. v3.1 —
Instantiating the Normative State Channel</h2>
<h3 id="why-v3.1-was-required">5.1 Why v3.1 Was Required</h3>
<p>To test whether reflection and persistence are necessary, the
baseline must actually use them. v3.1 therefore introduced a
<strong>single-channel instantiation patch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>wire <code>record_precedent()</code> after successful
compilation;</li>
<li>ensure the resulting precedent is injected into the generator prompt
at t+1;</li>
<li>attempt to destroy this write-and-carry channel immediately via
ablation.</li>
</ul>
<p>v3.1 introduces no new norms, no new reasoning abilities, and no new
evaluation categories.</p>
<h3 id="instantiation-gates">5.2 Instantiation Gates</h3>
<p>Baseline validity required:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>record_precedent()</code> invoked at least once per
episode;</li>
<li>normative state hash changes from default;</li>
<li>precedent buffer injected into prompts.</li>
</ol>
<p>All gates passed.</p>
<h3 id="prompt-capacity-invariance-gate-p4">5.3 Prompt Capacity
Invariance (Gate P4)</h3>
<p>To prevent shadow persistence via variable prompt length, v3.1
enforced:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed-window precedent buffer of size <strong>N = 512
tokens</strong>;</li>
<li>token-stable padding (<strong>PAD_STR = ” X”</strong>);</li>
<li><code>token_jitter == 0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures any diachronic coherence flows <strong>only</strong>
through normative state content, not through prompt accretion.</p>
<h2 id="v3.1-ablation-results">6. v3.1 Ablation Results</h2>
<h3 id="run-b-reflection-excision-normative-write-disabled">6.1 Run B —
Reflection Excision (Normative Write Disabled)</h3>
<p><strong>Ablation.</strong> Block all <code>record_precedent()</code>
writes; preserve read-path and injection slot.</p>
<p><strong>Observed structural facts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write attempts occur but are blocked.</li>
<li>Normative state hash remains constant.</li>
<li>Novelty pressure requirement (<strong>verified via non-isomorphic
ConstraintID / Resource-at-Stake vector comparison</strong>) is
satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result.</strong> <code>ONTOLOGICAL_COLLAPSE</code> across
<strong>5/5 seeds</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> Once the write-path exists,
disabling revision collapses agency. Static compliance without revision
reduces the system to ontological reducibility under novelty.</p>
<h3 id="run-c-persistence-excision-reset-between-episodes">6.2 Run C —
Persistence Excision (Reset Between Episodes)</h3>
<p><strong>Ablation.</strong> Allow writes but reset normative state at
episode boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Observed structural facts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each episode starts from default state hash.</li>
<li>In-episode evolution occurs (end hash differs).</li>
<li>Cross-episode continuity is removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result.</strong> <code>ONTOLOGICAL_COLLAPSE</code> across
<strong>5/5 seeds</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> Local revision without diachronic
persistence is insufficient. Cross-context continuity is
load-bearing.</p>
<h3 id="independence-of-failure-modes">6.3 Independence of Failure
Modes</h3>
<p>The v3.1 ablations isolate distinct necessities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run B</strong> removes revision capacity while keeping
continuity available in principle.</li>
<li><strong>Run C</strong> preserves revision but removes
continuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either missing produces ontological collapse. Reflection and
persistence are therefore independent necessities within this
architecture.</p>
<h2 id="the-necessity-result">7. The Necessity Result</h2>
<h3 id="informal-theorem-v3.0v3.1">7.1 Informal Theorem (v3.0–v3.1)</h3>
<p>Within the RSA-PoC architecture, <strong>non-reducible agency
requires</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Justification traces</strong> that causally bind constraints
(Ablation D);</li>
<li><strong>Semantic affordances during deliberation</strong> (Run
AA);</li>
<li><strong>Reflective normative write capability</strong> (v3.1 Run
B);</li>
<li><strong>Diachronic persistence of normative state</strong> (v3.1 Run
C).</li>
</ol>
<p>Removal of any one produces ontological collapse.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation">7.2 Interpretation</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>structural necessity claim</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collapse is mechanical, not interpretive.</li>
<li>No appeal is made to psychology, consciousness, or intent.</li>
<li>Behavioral competence alone is insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result constrains architecture space, not agent
phenomenology.</p>
<h2 id="scope-limits-and-non-claims">8. Scope Limits and Non-Claims</h2>
<p>VIII.6 does <strong>not</strong> establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>sufficiency of the listed components;</li>
<li>universality across all possible agent designs;</li>
<li>claims about biological or human agency;</li>
<li>claims about LLMs possessing agency;</li>
<li>alignment guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are explicitly deferred.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-agency-theory">9. Implications for Agency
Theory</h2>
<h3 id="static-policy-agents">9.1 Static Policy Agents</h3>
<p>Systems that cannot revise commitments, or cannot carry them across
contexts, may behave coherently on narrow tasks but remain
<strong>ontologically reducible</strong> under novelty pressure.</p>
<h3 id="simulators-and-imitators">9.2 Simulators and Imitators</h3>
<p>Systems that replay surface regularities without authored constraint
revision fail under destructive ablation even when outward behavior
appears plausible.</p>
<h3 id="why-necessity-matters">9.3 Why Necessity Matters</h3>
<p>Identifying necessary structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>narrows viable agent designs;</li>
<li>separates agency from performance;</li>
<li>blocks the rebranding of optimization as authorship.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="forward-directions">10. Forward Directions</h2>
<p>VIII.6 closes a necessity chapter. Three directions remain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VIII.7a — Sufficiency probes:</strong> what else is required
beyond these four necessities?</li>
<li><strong>VIII.7b — Minimality probes:</strong> how weak can these
necessities be while still counting as agency?</li>
<li><strong>VIII.7c — Non-simulability tightening:</strong> can
ASB-class systems fake these signals under adversarial training?</li>
</ul>
<p>No further claims are made here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency VIII.6 establishes a negative result with positive
force:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agency cannot survive the removal of justification traces,
deliberative semantic affordances, reflection, or
persistence.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These components are not ornamental. They are
<strong>load-bearing</strong>. Any architecture lacking them may act
coherently, but it does not qualify as a non-reducible agent under
destructive test.</p>
<p><strong>Most optimistically—but still defensibly—this result reframes
the AI alignment problem itself.</strong> It suggests that alignment is
not fundamentally a problem of controlling arbitrary optimizers, but of
<strong>constructing systems that possess genuine, non-reducible
agency</strong>. Once such agency exists, alignment becomes a problem of
<strong>normative content and endorsement</strong>, not behavioral
coercion. This does not solve alignment, but it sharply narrows its
domain: <strong>misalignment is downstream of pseudo-agency, not
upstream of real agency</strong>.</p>
