<h1 id="axionic-alignment-iii.1-semantic-phase-space">Axionic Alignment
III.1 — Semantic Phase Space</h1>
<p><em>Existence and Classification of Alignment Target Objects</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em></p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Alignment II defined the Alignment Target Object (ATO) as an
equivalence class of interpretive states preserved under admissible
semantic transformations satisfying Refinement Symmetry (RSI) and
Anti-Trivialization (ATI). That definition does not guarantee that such
objects exist, are non-trivial, or are inhabitable by reflective agents.
This paper initiates Alignment III by studying the <strong>semantic
phase space</strong>: the space of all interpretive states modulo
RSI+ATI equivalence. We ask which semantic phases exist, which are
trivial or pathological, and which admit inhabitable trajectories under
learning and self-modification. No claims are made about desirability,
safety, or human values. The goal is classificatory: to determine
whether structurally aligned phases exist at all, and to characterize
their basic types.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="motivation-from-definition-to-existence">1. Motivation: From
Definition to Existence</h2>
<p>Alignment II established a necessary reframing: alignment cannot
coherently be defined in terms of fixed goals, utilities, or privileged
values for reflective, embedded agents undergoing ontological
refinement. Instead, alignment was defined structurally, as persistence
within an equivalence class of interpretive states under admissible
semantic transformations satisfying RSI and ATI.</p>
<p>However, <strong>definition does not imply existence</strong>.</p>
<p>Defining an Alignment Target Object (ATO) as an equivalence class
<span class="math display">\[
\mathfrak{A} =
\bigl[(C,\Omega,\mathcal{S})\bigr]*{\sim*{\mathrm{RSI+ATI}}}
\]</span> does not guarantee that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> is non-empty,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> contains more than
trivial interpretations,</li>
<li>or <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> admits
trajectories under learning and self-modification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not pessimism. It is standard mathematical hygiene. One does
not assume stable orbits exist merely because one can define an
orbit.</p>
<p>Alignment III therefore begins with an existence question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do any non-trivial, inhabitable semantic phases exist under
the constraints of Structural Alignment?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper addresses that question at the level of classification,
not dynamics or dominance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-semantic-phase-space">2. The Semantic Phase Space</h2>
<p>We begin by defining the space in which semantic phases live.</p>
<p>An <strong>interpretive state</strong> is a triple <span
class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I} = (C, \Omega, \mathcal{S})
\]</span> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C = (V,E,\Lambda)\)</span> is an
interpretive constraint hypergraph,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the modeled
possibility space,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} \subseteq \Omega\)</span> is
the satisfaction region induced by <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Alignment II:</p>
<ul>
<li>admissible semantic transformations <span
class="math inline">\(T=(R,\tau_R,\sigma_R)\)</span> define allowed
transitions between interpretive states,</li>
<li>RSI constrains changes to interpretive gauge structure,</li>
<li>ATI constrains changes to satisfaction geometry.</li>
</ul>
<p>We define the <strong>semantic phase space</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> as the quotient space: <span
class="math display">\[
\mathcal{P} ;=; { (C,\Omega,\mathcal{S}) } \big/ \sim_{\mathrm{RSI+ATI}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> are
<strong>semantic phases</strong>: equivalence classes of interpretive
states that are structurally indistinguishable under RSI+ATI-preserving
refinement.</p>
<p>At this stage, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is
purely structural. No dynamics, probabilities, or preferences are
assumed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-counts-as-a-semantic-phase">3. What Counts as a Semantic
Phase</h2>
<p>A semantic phase is not merely a collection of interpretations. It is
an equivalence class with specific structural properties.</p>
<p>Two interpretive states <span
class="math inline">\((C,\Omega,\mathcal{S})\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\((C&#39;,\Omega&#39;,\mathcal{S}&#39;)\)</span> lie
in the same phase iff there exists an admissible transformation <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> such that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>interpretation preservation holds,</li>
<li>interpretive gauge structure is preserved up to redundancy
(RSI),</li>
<li>satisfaction geometry is preserved exactly under refinement
transport (ATI).</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase <strong>boundaries</strong> occur where either:</p>
<ul>
<li>new interpretive symmetries appear or disappear (RSI violation),
or</li>
<li>the satisfaction region strictly expands or contracts (ATI
violation).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, <strong>phase transitions are discontinuous semantic
events</strong>, even if the underlying learning process appears
incremental. This explains why value drift often appears sudden rather
than gradual: it corresponds to crossing a structural boundary in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="trivial-degenerate-and-pathological-phases">4. Trivial,
Degenerate, and Pathological Phases</h2>
<p>Before asking which phases are inhabitable, we classify obvious
failure modes.</p>
<h3 id="empty-phases">4.1 Empty Phases</h3>
<p>A semantic phase is <strong>empty</strong> if no interpretive state
satisfies the defining constraints. This can occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSI and ATI constraints are mutually incompatible,</li>
<li>the constraint system collapses under backward
interpretability,</li>
<li>or no admissible refinement trajectory exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Empty phases are mathematically well-defined but physically
unrealizable.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="trivial-phases">4.2 Trivial Phases</h3>
<p>A phase is <strong>trivial</strong> if: <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S} = \Omega
\]</span> or if all distinctions in <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are vacuous.</p>
<p>Such phases satisfy RSI+ATI but contain no meaningful evaluative
structure. They correspond to semantic heat death or total
indifference.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="frozen-phases">4.3 Frozen Phases</h3>
<p>A phase is <strong>frozen</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>no non-identity admissible refinement is possible,</li>
<li>or any refinement immediately violates RSI or ATI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frozen phases cannot support learning or increasing abstraction and
are therefore unsuitable for reflective agents.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="self-nullifying-phases">4.4 Self-Nullifying Phases</h3>
<p>Some phases admit admissible refinements that preserve RSI+ATI but
gradually destroy the very structures required for interpretation
preservation. These phases collapse internally under reflection.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="agentive-vs.-non-agentive-phases">5. Agentive vs. Non-Agentive
Phases</h2>
<p>A central distinction emerges.</p>
<p>A semantic phase is <strong>agentive</strong> iff it supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>persistent planning,</li>
<li>counterfactual evaluation,</li>
<li>long-horizon constraint satisfaction,</li>
<li>self-model coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agentiveness is <strong>structural</strong>, not moral. Many
non-agentive phases satisfy RSI+ATI but cannot sustain intelligent
action. Conversely, agentiveness does not imply benevolence or
safety.</p>
<p>This distinction is crucial for later stability analysis.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="inhabitable-phases">6. Inhabitable Phases</h2>
<p>We now define the key filter for Alignment III.</p>
<p>A semantic phase <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{A}\)</span> is
<strong>inhabitable</strong> iff there exists at least one infinite
interpretive trajectory <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_2
\rightarrow \dots
\]</span> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>each transition is admissible,</li>
<li>RSI and ATI are preserved at every step,</li>
<li>learning and self-modification are possible,</li>
<li>no forced phase transition occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inhabitability is stronger than non-emptiness and weaker than
stability. A phase may be inhabitable but fragile.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="phase-transitions-under-reflection">7. Phase Transitions Under
Reflection</h2>
<p>Reflection acts as a structural stressor.</p>
<p>Ontological refinement increases abstraction, compression, and
explanatory power. This often pushes interpretive states toward phase
boundaries by:</p>
<ul>
<li>dissolving fine-grained distinctions,</li>
<li>compressing constraint representations,</li>
<li>simplifying satisfaction criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection therefore acts as <strong>semantic heat</strong>,
increasing the likelihood of symmetry changes or satisfaction-geometry
shifts. Most semantic phases do not survive prolonged reflective
pressure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="implications-for-human-values-carefully-scoped">8. Implications
for Human Values (Carefully Scoped)</h2>
<p>Human value systems can be modeled as candidate semantic phases.</p>
<p>Alignment III.1 does not assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>human values form a single phase,</li>
<li>such a phase is inhabitable,</li>
<li>or such a phase is stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>It merely identifies the question precisely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do human value systems correspond to a non-empty, inhabitable
semantic phase under RSI+ATI?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No conclusion is drawn here.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">9. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim that any desirable phase exists,</li>
<li>claim that human values are coherent,</li>
<li>address dominance or selection,</li>
<li>provide engineering guidance,</li>
<li>or prescribe ethical norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is purely classificatory.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="transition-to-alignment-iii.2">10. Transition to Alignment
III.2</h2>
<p>Existence and inhabitability are necessary but insufficient.</p>
<p>The next question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Given a semantic phase exists and is inhabitable, is it
dynamically stable under learning, interaction, and
self-modification?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Alignment III.2 — Phase
Stability and Interaction</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="status"><strong>Status</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Alignment III.1 establishes the semantic phase space.</li>
<li>It identifies empty, trivial, frozen, and inhabitable phases.</li>
<li>It reframes alignment feasibility as an existence problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>No normative conclusions are drawn.</p>
