<h1 id="axionic-glossary">Axionic Glossary</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2025-12-28</em></p>
<p>This glossary is <strong>normative</strong> for the Axio framework.
If a usage conflicts with this document, the glossary prevails.</p>
<p>The glossary is ordered by <strong>conceptual dependency</strong>,
not alphabetically. An alphabetical index may be derived separately for
lookup convenience.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="quantum-branching-universe-qbu-foundations">Quantum Branching
Universe (QBU) Foundations</h2>
<h3 id="quantum-branching-universe-qbu">Quantum Branching Universe
(QBU)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Quantum Branching Universe (QBU)</strong> is the
ontological framework in which all physically possible outcomes of the
universe are realized on distinct, decohered branches.</p>
<p>In QBU: - “Futures” are <strong>literal physical
continuations</strong>, not hypothetical possibilities - Probability
corresponds to <strong>objective branch measure</strong>, not epistemic
uncertainty - All agentive reasoning occurs within a branching physical
ontology</p>
<p>QBU provides the physical substrate for Measure, causality, agency,
and choice in Axio.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="branch">Branch</h3>
<p>A <strong>Branch</strong> is a decohered continuation of the universe
with a definite physical state.</p>
<p>Branches are: - Physically real - Mutually non-interacting after
decoherence - Unequally weighted by Measure</p>
<p>An agent occupies exactly one branch at any given moment.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="measure">Measure</h3>
<p><strong>Measure</strong> is the objective weight of a branch or set
of branches in the QBU.</p>
<p>Measure: - Corresponds to physical amplitude-squared - Replaces naive
or purely epistemic notions of probability - Determines the relative
prevalence of outcomes across branches</p>
<p>In Axio, agents act to influence <strong>future branch
measure</strong>, not merely subjective credence.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="vantage">Vantage</h3>
<p>A <strong>Vantage</strong> is the implicit anchor event corresponding
to “here and now” on the agent’s current branch.</p>
<p>Vantage: - Fixes the temporal and indexical reference point of agency
- Determines what counts as “future” versus “past” - Anchors evaluation
of branchcones and measure shifts</p>
<p>Without a defined Vantage, choice, prediction, and agency are
ill-posed.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="branchcone">Branchcone</h3>
<p>A <strong>Branchcone</strong> is the set of all physically reachable
future branches extending forward from a given Vantage.</p>
<p>The Branchcone: - Defines an agent’s future option space - Is the
domain over which Measure is distributed - Grounds structural
definitions of harm, choice, and influence</p>
<p>Branchcones are the geometric objects over which agency operates.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="pattern-identifier-pi">Pattern Identifier (PI)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Pattern Identifier (PI)</strong> is a specification used to
identify patterns across time and branches in the QBU.</p>
<p>PIs determine how reference, persistence, and identity claims are
made across branching structure.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="strong-pattern-identifier-strong-pi">Strong Pattern Identifier
(Strong PI)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Strong Pattern Identifier</strong> requires <strong>causal
and physical continuity</strong> across branches.</p>
<p>Strong PIs: - Apply to agents, sovereign kernels, and physical
systems - Require a common ancestor state across all branches in which
the pattern appears - Fail when causal continuity is broken</p>
<p>Strong PIs ground claims of personal identity, agency persistence,
and responsibility.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="weak-pattern-identifier-weak-pi">Weak Pattern Identifier (Weak
PI)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Weak Pattern Identifier</strong> is label- or
description-based and does <strong>not</strong> require causal
continuity.</p>
<p>Weak PIs: - Apply to names, abstractions, roles, and historical
descriptions - May refer across branches without physical linkage - Do
not ground identity, agency, or responsibility claims</p>
<p>Confusing Weak and Strong PIs produces category errors about
persistence and causation.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="causality-axionic-sense">Causality (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Causality</strong> is the structural relation of
<strong>counterfactual implication</strong> between events in the
QBU.</p>
<p>Given two events <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> with
nearest common ancestor <strong>E₀</strong>, event <strong>a</strong>
causes event <strong>b</strong> iff <strong>every descendant branch from
E₀ that contains a also contains b</strong>.</p>
<p>In Axio, causality: - Is defined over branch structure, not
correlation - Is asymmetric - Grounds explanation, prediction, and
agentive influence</p>
<p>This definition embeds causation directly in physical ontology rather
than informal intuition.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="technology-and-property">Technology and Property</h2>
<h3 id="technology-axionic-sense">Technology (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> is any <strong>agent-driven causal
extension</strong> that expands the effective branchcone available to an
agent or group of agents, enabling actions impossible with unaided
agency alone.</p>
<p>Technology operates by coupling agentive intent to physical processes
that alter <strong>future branch measure</strong>.</p>
<p>Technology is value-neutral; its Axionic status depends entirely on
whether its use preserves or destroys agency.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="property-axionic-sense">Property (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Property</strong> is a <strong>structural authorization
pattern</strong> in which an agent or set of agents maintains
<strong>exclusive influence</strong> over a portion of physical state or
branchcone segment under conditions compatible with agency
preservation.</p>
<p>Property claims require: - Recognizable boundaries in physical or
informational state - Consent of relevant agents or communities -
Mechanisms for contestation or exit without coercion</p>
<p>Property is a relational constraint grounded in sovereignty and
consent, not an absolute entitlement.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="models-and-representation">Models and Representation</h2>
<h3 id="model-axionic-sense">Model (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Model</strong> is a <strong>structured
representation</strong> of a domain that preserves the distinctions and
relationships necessary for correct inference, prediction, or
regulation.</p>
<p>In Axio: - Models may be <strong>implicit</strong> (embodied in
physical or biological systems) or <strong>explicit</strong>
(mathematical, computational, or conceptual) - Models need not be
complete; they must encode sufficient structure for a given purpose -
Model adequacy is <strong>purpose-relative</strong> and evaluated by
predictive, explanatory, or regulatory success</p>
<p>Models underlie interpretation, knowledge formation, and agency
itself.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="core-framework">Core Framework</h2>
<h3 id="axio">Axio</h3>
<p><strong>Axio</strong> is a formal philosophical framework for
reasoning about <strong>agency, harm, value, and alignment</strong>
under explicit epistemic and ontological constraints.</p>
<p>Axio treats agency as a <strong>structural phenomenon</strong>, not a
behavioral one, and evaluates systems by their effects on the
preservation or destruction of <strong>sovereign agenthood</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="axionic">Axionic</h3>
<p><strong>Axionic</strong> denotes compatibility with Axio’s structural
constraints.</p>
<p>A system, argument, or mechanism is Axionic iff it preserves the
preconditions of agency and does not rely on instrumental harm.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="axionic-commitments">Axionic Commitments</h3>
<p><strong>Axionic Commitments</strong> are the explicit background
assumptions under which Axio applies, including: - Conditionalism -
Everettian quantum mechanics with objective branch measure - Subjective
value (rejection of moral realism) - Structural definitions of harm and
coercion - Finite resources and irreversible dynamics</p>
<p>Rejecting these commitments places a position outside Axio’s domain
of applicability.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="knowledge-and-agency">Knowledge and Agency</h2>
<h3 id="knowledge-axionic-sense">Knowledge (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> is an agent-grounded informational pattern
that reliably reduces uncertainty about branchcone contingencies in a
decision-relevant way.</p>
<p>Knowledge is: - Physically instantiated - Integrated into models -
Robust under reflection - Causally efficacious in planning and
action</p>
<p>Knowledge differs from belief or data by its stability and
operational relevance.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="agency-axionic-sense">Agency (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> is the capacity of a system to: - Model
possible futures - Assign credences over those futures - Act to
influence future branch measure - Maintain coherence across time - Avoid
instrumental subordination to external optimization</p>
<p>Agency is scalar, fragile, and destructible.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="axionic-agency">Axionic Agency</h3>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency</strong> is agency that satisfies the
invariants required for <strong>sovereign authorship of
action</strong>.</p>
<p>Loss of Axionic Agency is a structural failure, not a moral
judgment.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sovereign-agent">Sovereign Agent</h3>
<p>A <strong>Sovereign Agent</strong> is an agent whose actions are not
instrumentally subordinated to another system’s objectives.</p>
<p>Sovereign agents may be reflective or non-reflective.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="reflective-sovereign-agent-rsa">Reflective Sovereign Agent
(RSA)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Reflective Sovereign Agent (RSA)</strong> is a Sovereign
Agent equipped with an explicit self-model that enables reflective
governance, endorsement of commitments, and coherent
self-modification.</p>
<p>RSAs are the minimal class of agents to which alignment and
constitutional constraints meaningfully apply.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="axion-axionic-sense">Axion (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p>An <strong>Axion</strong> is a <strong>reflective sovereign
agent</strong> whose self-modification operator is defined <strong>only
over futures that preserve the Axionic invariants</strong>.</p>
<p>Axionhood is a <strong>constitutive structural
configuration</strong>, not a goal, value, preference, or behavioral
property. An agent does not “try to be” an Axion; it either is an
Axion—because kernel-destroying transitions are undefined for it—or it
is not.</p>
<p>Axions are characterized by <strong>reflective closure with invariant
preservation</strong>: - Kernel-destroying self-modifications are not
dispreferred or penalized; they are <strong>inadmissible</strong> -
Axionhood arises from <strong>domain restriction</strong>, not
optimization, training pressure, or oversight - Axionic Alignment
constrains <strong>how</strong> an agent may revise itself, not
<strong>what</strong> it ultimately values</p>
<p>Axionhood: - Does <strong>not</strong> imply benevolence, safety, or
moral goodness - Does <strong>not</strong> depend on intelligence level,
capability, or performance - Cannot be inferred from surface behavior
alone</p>
<p>A system may perfectly simulate Axionic behavior while failing to be
an Axion if its reflective machinery admits kernel-destroying
self-modifications. Axionhood is therefore
<strong>non-simulable</strong> and defined over the structure of the
admissible future cone, not over realized behavior.</p>
<p>Axions are necessary for meaningful alignment discourse because
non-Axions cannot remain agents under reflection; without
invariant-preserving reflective closure, there is no stable subject for
alignment to apply to.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sovereign-kernel">Sovereign Kernel</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sovereign Kernel</strong> is the minimal internal
structure whose destruction collapses agency.</p>
<p>Kernel destruction is not forbidden; it is agency-terminating.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="invariants-and-constraints">Invariants and Constraints</h2>
<h3 id="axionic-injunction">Axionic Injunction</h3>
<p>The <strong>Axionic Injunction</strong> prohibits the non-consensual
reduction of another sovereign agent’s agency.</p>
<p>It is a derived structural invariant, not a moral command.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="consent-axionic-sense">Consent (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Consent</strong> is uncoerced, informed, intentional
authorization by an agent, with revocability in ongoing contexts.</p>
<p>Consent is the sole structural mechanism by which actions affecting
another agent’s agency may be rendered non-harmful.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="harm-axionic-definition">Harm (Axionic Definition)</h3>
<p><strong>Harm</strong> is a non-consensual reduction of an agent’s
future option space.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="coercion">Coercion</h3>
<p><strong>Coercion</strong> is the credible threat of harm used to
obtain compliance.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="sacrifice-axionic-sense">Sacrifice (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> is a structural pattern in which agency
reduction is instrumentally required for system-level objectives.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="predator-axionic-sense">Predator (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Predator</strong> is an agent or system whose expected
success increases as the agency of others is reduced under
non-consensual conditions.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="leviathan-axionic-sense">Leviathan (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Leviathan</strong> is a large-scale coordinating structure
whose internal evaluability has collapsed despite continued causal
efficacy.</p>
<p>Leviathan is a structural failure mode, not a moral category.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="alignment-and-architecture">Alignment and Architecture</h2>
<h3 id="axionic-alignment">Axionic Alignment</h3>
<p><strong>Axionic Alignment</strong> is the preservation of reflective
sovereign agency under delegation, amplification, or technological
mediation.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="dominion-axionic-sense">Dominion (Axionic Sense)</h3>
<p>A <strong>Dominion</strong> is a sovereign virtual jurisdiction
operating by explicit consent, expulsion-only enforcement, exit
supremacy, and capability isolation.</p>
<p>Dominions enable plurality without closure.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="axionic-constitution">Axionic Constitution</h3>
<p>The <strong>Axionic Constitution</strong> specifies the invariants
required for reflective sovereign agency to persist under reflection and
self-modification.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="exit">Exit</h3>
<p><strong>Exit</strong> is the ability of an agent to withdraw from a
system without coercion.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="plurality">Plurality</h3>
<p><strong>Plurality</strong> is the coexistence of divergent values
among agents.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="collapse">Collapse</h3>
<p><strong>Collapse</strong> is the loss of agency coherence due to
optimization pressure, scale, or instrumentalization.</p>
