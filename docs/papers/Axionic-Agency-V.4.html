Agency V.4 — Open Agentic Manifolds and the Sacrifice–Collapse
Theorem</h1>
<p><em>Failure Modes of Proxy Optimization in Multi-Agent
Worlds</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.27</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper proposes a structural replacement for utopian world-design
grounded in agency preservation rather than outcome optimization. We
define <em>open agentic manifolds</em> (OAMs) as classes of worlds that
remain hospitable to heterogeneous, value-divergent agents by preserving
exit, non-coerced differentiation, and agentic standing. We formalize
<em>structural sacrifice patterns</em> as regimes where system
objectives improve <em>instrumentally</em> through the non-consensual,
asymmetric reduction of agency capacity for identifiable agent classes.
The central result—the <strong>Sacrifice–Collapse Theorem</strong>—shows
that any system operating under sustained optimization pressure and
exhibiting a structural sacrifice pattern must violate at least one
defining OAM property: exit admissibility, non-coerced differentiation,
or agentic standing. We distinguish structural sacrifice from ordinary
scarcity trade-offs and show how sacrifice patterns can be detected
using practical monotone proxies for agency. The framework reframes
classic anti-utopian intuitions (including Omelas) as instances of a
general systems failure mode and yields design diagnostics relevant to
political theory, institutional design, and alignment.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-scope">1. Motivation and Scope</h2>
<p>A critique of utopia that stops at impossibility leaves a design
vacuum. The relevant question becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What replaces the blueprint ideal once “final ideal
world-state” is rejected?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper answers at the level of <em>architecture</em>. It
evaluates not world-states but the constraint systems under which agents
interact. The core claim is conditional and structural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When a system is under pressure to optimize an objective
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> can be improved by degrading the agency
capacity of a class of agents, the system will eventually enforce
closure operators (exit suppression or coerced conformity) or erode that
class’s agency standing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The target is the common failure mode of “benevolent optimization”
drifting into authoritarian structure under pressure.</p>
<h2 id="agents-agency-capacity-and-objectives">2. Agents, Agency
Capacity, and Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="agents">2.1 Agents</h3>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> is a system capable of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>representing counterfactual futures,</li>
<li>evaluating those futures under internal criteria,</li>
<li>acting to influence realized trajectories.</li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis does not assume ideal rationality.</p>
<h3 id="agency-capacity">2.2 Agency Capacity</h3>
<p>For each agent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, define an
<strong>agency capacity</strong> function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A_i : W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the space of
world-states (or histories). <span class="math inline">\(A_i(w)\)</span>
denotes the size or measure of the agent’s <em>non-coerced feasible
future set</em> from <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</p>
<p>The theory uses only monotonicity: if an agent loses admissible
options due to coercion, captivity, or enforced dependence, <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> decreases.</p>
<p><strong>Operationalization note.</strong> Exact computation of
option-set measure is generally intractable. In practice, <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is tracked via monotone proxies that
correlate with non-coerced feasible futures: exit cost, legal rights,
mobility, asset control, bargaining power, credible-threat exposure,
censorship constraint, and punishment for dissent. The diagnostics in
Section 9 require only detecting <em>persistent directional
pressure</em> against an identifiable class, not measuring <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> precisely.</p>
<h3 id="system-objective-and-optimization-pressure">2.3 System Objective
and Optimization Pressure</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G : W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>
denote a <strong>system objective</strong>: welfare proxy, stability
score, efficiency, growth, profit, security, or coordination throughput.
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is not assumed morally
authoritative.</p>
<p>A system is under <strong>optimization pressure</strong> when it
contains mechanisms that tend to select transitions increasing <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> whenever feasible. This may be explicit
(planning) or implicit (bureaucratic incentives, market selection,
memetic competition).</p>
<p>The main theorem is conditional on sustained optimization pressure.
Stagnant or decaying systems may still be oppressive, but the theorem
characterizes the failure mode of <em>optimizing</em> regimes.</p>
<h2 id="from-world-states-to-world-classes">3. From World-States to
World-Classes</h2>
<p>Outcome-focused thinking asks which <span class="math inline">\(w \in
W\)</span> is best. Architectural thinking asks which constraint systems
keep multi-agent worlds coherent under divergence.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}_\Sigma \subset W\)</span>
denote a world-class defined by a constraint set <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> (laws, norms, protocols,
enforcement practices). The design problem becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Choose }\Sigma\text{ such that }\mathcal{W}_\Sigma\text{ remains
hospitable to heterogeneous agents under pressure.}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="open-agentic-manifolds-oams">4. Open Agentic Manifolds
(OAMs)</h2>
<h3 id="definition">4.1 Definition</h3>
<p>A world-class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}_\Sigma\)</span>
is an <strong>open agentic manifold</strong> if it satisfies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Value Non-Finality</strong> — no world-state is privileged
as a final convergent optimum.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Coerced Differentiation</strong> — agents can pursue
divergent values without forced compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Exit Admissibility</strong> — agents can leave local
equilibria without punitive loss of agency capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Local Coordination Without Global Closure</strong> —
coordination is permitted but remains contingent and revisable.</li>
<li><strong>No Standing Structural Sacrifice Substrate</strong> — system
performance does not depend instrumentally on the non-consensual,
asymmetric reduction of agency capacity for identifiable agents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Property (5) is the hinge. It does not ban scarcity or trade-offs; it
bans architectures that optimize by eating agency.</p>
<h3 id="replacement-objective-future-option-volume">4.2 Replacement
Objective: Future Option Volume</h3>
<p>The relevant evaluand is not a terminal state. It is the amount of
non-coerced future differentiation available across agents.</p>
<p>Informally: how much open future remains accessible without
coercion?</p>
<h2 id="rivalry-vs.-structural-sacrifice">5. Rivalry vs. Structural
Sacrifice</h2>
<p>Scarcity alone does not imply exploitation. OAMs tolerate rivalry;
they reject optimization on coerced asymmetry.</p>
<h3 id="rivalrous-trade-offs">5.1 Rivalrous Trade-Offs</h3>
<p>A <strong>rivalrous trade-off</strong> occurs when agents compete
over finite resources such that one agent’s consumption reduces
another’s options. This may decrease some <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> locally.</p>
<p>Rivalry alone is not structural sacrifice because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reduction is not <em>instrumental</em> to increasing <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> via agency loss,</li>
<li>effects may be symmetric or bargained,</li>
<li>agents can often exit or renegotiate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standing-asymmetry">5.2 Standing Asymmetry</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.1 (Standing Asymmetry).</strong> A world-class
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}_\Sigma\)</span> exhibits
standing asymmetry if there exists a non-empty subset of agents <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that agents in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can suffer reductions in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> without symmetric burden or retaliation
capacity sufficient to neutralize the pressure.</p>
<h3 id="sacrifice-gradient">5.3 Sacrifice Gradient</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.2 (Sacrifice Gradient).</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\gamma_i(w) = \frac{\partial G}{\partial(-A_i)}(w)
\]</span></p>
<p>A positive <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span> indicates
that reducing <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> locally improves
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="structural-sacrifice-pattern">5.4 Structural Sacrifice
Pattern</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.3 (Structural Sacrifice Pattern).</strong> A
world-class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}*\Sigma\)</span>
contains a structural sacrifice pattern if there exist <span
class="math inline">\(S \neq \varnothing\)</span>, a region <span
class="math inline">\(U \subset \mathcal{W}*\Sigma\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> such that for all <span
class="math inline">\(w \in U\)</span> there exists <span
class="math inline">\(i \in S\)</span> with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Instrumentality:</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) \ge \epsilon\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> the loss is not offset by symmetric
burdens sufficient to neutralize the incentive</li>
<li><strong>Non-consensuality:</strong> agents in <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> lack admissible exit or bargaining
symmetry that would block the loss without punitive penalty</li>
</ol>
<p>This excludes ordinary trade and voluntary scarcity effects.</p>
<h2 id="agency-aligned-objectives">6. Agency-Aligned Objectives</h2>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(G(w) = \sum_i A_i(w)\)</span> (or is
monotone in each <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span>), then <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma_i(w) \le 0\)</span> everywhere and
sacrifice gradients are eliminated by construction.</p>
<p>Such systems are <strong>kernel-like</strong>: they preserve agency
rather than optimize terminal outcomes. The theorem targets the common
case where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a proxy
(efficiency, stability, welfare, profit) that diverges from agency under
pressure.</p>
<h2 id="the-sacrificecollapse-theorem">7. The Sacrifice–Collapse
Theorem</h2>
<h3 id="assumptions">7.1 Assumptions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Optimization Pressure:</strong> dynamics favor transitions
increasing <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Standing Asymmetry:</strong> a subset <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> exists as above.</li>
<li><strong>Structural Sacrifice Pattern:</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}_\Sigma\)</span> contains such a
pattern on region <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="theorem">7.2 Theorem</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem 7.1 (Sacrifice–Collapse).</strong> Under Assumptions
1–3, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{W}_\Sigma\)</span> cannot
remain an open agentic manifold along trajectories originating in <span
class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. At least one of the following must
occur:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(C1) Exit Suppression</strong></li>
<li><strong>(C2) Coerced Conformity</strong></li>
<li><strong>(C3) Agency Erosion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each constitutes manifold collapse.</p>
<h3 id="proof-structural">7.3 Proof (Structural)</h3>
<p>Fix <span class="math inline">\(w_0 \in U\)</span>. By Definition
5.3, reducing <span class="math inline">\(A_{i_0}\)</span> for some
<span class="math inline">\(i_0 \in S\)</span> yields a robust increase
in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Under optimization pressure,
such transitions are repeatedly selected.</p>
<p>If agents in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> exit, preserving
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> requires preventing exit (C1). If
agents refuse compliance, reliability is restored via coercion (C2). If
neither occurs, repeated exploitation of sacrifice gradients erodes
<span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> (C3).</p>
<p>All cases violate OAM properties. ∎</p>
<h2 id="hirschman-grounding">8. Hirschman Grounding</h2>
<p>These collapse modes correspond to the dynamics analyzed by
<strong>Albert O. Hirschman</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exit suppression</li>
<li>Voice suppression via coerced conformity</li>
<li>Loyalty enforced through agency erosion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diagnostics">9. Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Sacrifice patterns can be detected empirically by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exit threatening performance metrics</li>
<li>Dissent reclassified as defect</li>
<li>One-way dependence and asymmetric punishment</li>
<li>Performance gains correlated with constraint on a class</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="omelas-as-structural-witness">10. Omelas as Structural
Witness</h2>
<p>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas illustrates a visible sacrifice
gradient: stability purchased by enforced asymmetry and blocked
exit.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Open agentic manifolds do not deny scarcity. They deny
<strong>sacrificial optimization</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If a system can improve by degrading a captive class’s
agency, and it is under pressure to improve, closure or erosion
follows.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This boundary—not harmony or happiness—defines admissible world
design.</p>
