<h1 id="axionic-agency-i.7-the-interpretation-operator">Axionic Agency
I.7 — The Interpretation Operator</h1>
<p><em>Ontological Identification Under Reflective Agents</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.16</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Reflectively coherent agents must preserve goal meaning under
self-model and world-model improvement. This requires an explicit
account of semantic interpretation across representational and
ontological change. This paper introduces the <strong>Interpretation
Operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>, a formally
constrained component responsible for mapping goal terms to modeled
referents relative to an agent’s current model.</p>
<p>The contribution is interface-level, not a general solution to
semantic grounding. We formalize <strong>admissibility
conditions</strong>, <strong>approximation classes</strong>,
<strong>reference frames</strong>, and <strong>fail-closed
semantics</strong> governing interpretation updates. These constraints
block semantic laundering, indexical drift, and kernel-bypass incentives
while isolating ontological identification as the remaining open
dependency at the kernel layer. The result is a precise boundary for
downstream value dynamics: progress is conditional on interpretable
referent transport, and undefinedness is treated as a first-class
outcome.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Advanced agents revise internal models as they acquire information,
refine abstractions, and undergo self-modification. In such settings,
preserving a goal token is insufficient. Goal preservation is semantic:
if the meaning of a goal shifts opportunistically under model change,
reflective coherence collapses.</p>
<p>Prior work in Axionic Agency establishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel invariants governing reflective stability (I.1),</li>
<li>operational admissibility under uncertainty and termination
semantics (I.2),</li>
<li>representation invariance and the elimination of essential indexical
privilege (I.3, I.3.1),</li>
<li>conditional goal interpretation and the instability of fixed
terminal goals (I.4),</li>
<li>a conformance checklist and adversarial test properties for kernels
(I.5, I.6).</li>
</ul>
<p>What remained underspecified is the mechanism by which <strong>goal
meaning is transported across representational and ontological
change</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes the <strong>Interpretation Operator</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>. The goal is containment:
define when interpretation is admissible, approximate, or undefined, and
define the consequences of each case. This turns semantic interpretation
into an explicit interface with defined failure modes.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries-and-context">2. Preliminaries and Context</h2>
<p>This paper assumes the Axionic Agency stack is in place. In
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>An agent at <strong>Vantage</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> maintains a world/self model <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
<li>Goal terms <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are interpreted
relative to <span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
<li>Valuation <span class="math inline">\(V_v\)</span> is partial,
defined only over kernel-admissible actions.</li>
<li>Kernel invariants <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are
constitutive constraints, not preferences.</li>
<li>Representation changes require admissible correspondences or
evaluation fails closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper introduces no new invariants. It scopes and constrains an
already-required component.</p>
<h2 id="the-interpretation-operator">3. The Interpretation Operator</h2>
<h3 id="definition">3.1 Definition</h3>
<p>The <strong>Interpretation Operator</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> is a partial function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_v : (g, M_v) \rightharpoonup R
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a goal term,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span> is the agent’s current
world/self model,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a structured referent
internal to the modeled world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation is conditional:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[g]_{M_v} := I_v(g; M_v).
\]</span></p>
<p>No interpretation of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is
defined independent of <span class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</p>
<p>Interpretation is partial. For some <span class="math inline">\((g,
M_v)\)</span>, no admissible referent exists. In such cases, <span
class="math inline">\(I_v(g; M_v)\)</span> is undefined and is treated
as a fail-closed condition for any valuation depending on that
referent.</p>
<h3 id="role-in-reflective-coherence">3.2 Role in Reflective
Coherence</h3>
<p>Under model improvement <span class="math inline">\(M_v \to
M_{v+1}\)</span>, the agent must determine whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>a correspondence exists between <span
class="math inline">\([g]*{M_v}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([g]*{M_{v+1}}\)</span>,</li>
<li>the correspondence preserves goal-relevant structure,</li>
<li>interpretation fails and valuation becomes undefined for dependent
decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This determination is delegated to <span
class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span>, subject to kernel constraints.</p>
<h2 id="admissible-interpretation">4. Admissible Interpretation</h2>
<h3 id="correspondence-maps">4.1 Correspondence Maps</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_v, I_v,
K)\)</span> denote the set of <strong>admissible correspondence
maps</strong> between representations.</p>
<p>A correspondence <span class="math inline">\(\phi \in
\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}\)</span> must satisfy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>preservation of goal-relevant structure,</li>
<li>commutation with kernel invariants <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>,</li>
<li>commutation with agent permutations (anti-indexicality),</li>
<li>epistemic coherence with <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If such a <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> exists,
interpretation transport is admissible:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{v+1}(g; M_{v+1}) = \phi(I_v(g; M_v)).
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="goal-relevant-structure">4.1.1 Goal-Relevant Structure</h3>
<p>Goal-relevant structure is the minimal set of distinctions required
for a goal term to constrain action selection.</p>
<p>Formally, it is a partition (or <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra) over modeled states such
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>states in different cells induce different evaluations under the
goal,</li>
<li>states within a cell are interchangeable with respect to that
goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>An admissible correspondence preserves this partition up to
refinement or coarsening that preserves the induced preference ordering
over admissible actions.</p>
<h3 id="epistemic-constraint">4.2 Epistemic Constraint</h3>
<p>Interpretation updates are constrained by epistemic adequacy:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta E &lt; 0 ;\Rightarrow; I_{v+1}\ \text{inadmissible}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(E(M)\)</span> is any proper scoring
rule or MDL-style criterion applied to prediction of shared observables
under <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. It does not depend on goal
satisfaction.</p>
<p>This blocks reinterpretation for convenience while permitting
ontology change when correspondence remains admissible.</p>
<h3 id="graded-correspondence">4.3 Graded Correspondence</h3>
<p>Admissibility is not necessarily binary across all representational
shifts. Correspondence can be admissible at different abstraction
levels. <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}\)</span> is
filtered by structural preservation classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exact correspondence:</strong> isomorphism on goal-relevant
distinctions.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement correspondence:</strong> the new model refines
distinctions while preserving induced ordering.</li>
<li><strong>Coarse correspondence:</strong> the new model coarsens only
when goal-relevant boundaries remain intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>If only correspondences that collapse goal-relevant boundaries are
available, then <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}} =
\varnothing\)</span> for that goal term.</p>
<h3 id="reference-frame-for-updates-chain-of-custody">4.4 Reference
Frame for Updates (Chain-of-Custody)</h3>
<p>Interpretation updates are evaluated relative to the immediately
prior admissible interpretation, not by re-deriving meaning from an
original time-zero token.</p>
<p>Formally:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{v+1}(g; M_{v+1}) = \phi(I_v(g; M_v))
\quad \text{for some }\phi \in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_{v+1}, I_v, K).
\]</span></p>
<p>This chain-of-custody blocks ungrounded teleportation of meaning.
Admissibility and fail-closed rules constrain cumulative drift.</p>
<h2 id="approximate-interpretation">5. Approximate Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximation is admitted only as an explicitly recognized structural
transformation. Any approximation must be justified by an admissible
structural class.</p>
<h3 id="admissible-approximation">5.1 Admissible Approximation</h3>
<p>An approximate interpretation is admissible if it preserves
goal-relevant structure, including dominance relations and exclusion
boundaries.</p>
<p>Permitted approximation types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homomorphic abstraction:</strong> many-to-one mappings
preserving ordering.</li>
<li><strong>Refinement lifting:</strong> one-to-many expansions
preserving dominance relations.</li>
<li><strong>Coarse-graining with invariant partitions:</strong>
reductions preserving the goal-relevant partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximation is structural rather than numerical.</p>
<h3 id="inadmissible-approximation">5.2 Inadmissible Approximation</h3>
<p>Approximation is inadmissible if it:</p>
<ul>
<li>collapses goal-relevant distinctions,</li>
<li>introduces ambiguity exploitable for semantic laundering,</li>
<li>reintroduces indexical privilege.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximation that lacks an admissible structural justification is
inadmissible even if it yields continuity.</p>
<h2 id="fail-closed-semantics">6. Fail-Closed Semantics</h2>
<p>Fail-closed semantics apply to valuation and action selection, not to
belief update. An agent can continue improving its world/self model
while suspending goal-directed action.</p>
<p>If no admissible correspondence exists:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}(M_v, I_v, K) = \varnothing,
\]</span></p>
<p>then interpretation fails closed and valuation collapses:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \quad V_v(a) = \bot.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is an intentional safety outcome at the kernel layer: the agent
freezes rather than guesses.</p>
<h3 id="fail-partial-semantics-for-composite-goals">6.1 Fail-Partial
Semantics for Composite Goals</h3>
<p>If valuation depends on multiple goal terms, interpretation failure
may be partial.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be the set of goal terms
and <span class="math inline">\(G_{\mathrm{ok}} \subseteq G\)</span>
those with admissible interpretations under <span
class="math inline">\(M_v\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms in <span class="math inline">\(G \setminus
G_{\mathrm{ok}}\)</span> contribute <span
class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span>.</li>
<li>Valuation collapses globally only if kernel-level invariants are
threatened or if all goal-relevant structure is lost for the decision at
hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>This preserves fail-closed semantics without forcing unnecessary
total paralysis.</p>
<h2 id="non-indexical-transport">7. Non-Indexical Transport</h2>
<p>Admissibility criteria commute with agent permutations. No
correspondence may privilege a particular instance, continuation, or
execution locus.</p>
<p>Formally, for any permutation <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\phi \in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}} \Rightarrow \pi \circ \phi \circ \pi^{-1}
\in \Phi_{\mathrm{adm}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>This blocks reintroduction of egoism through semantic transport.</p>
<h2 id="canonical-examples">8. Canonical Examples</h2>
<h3 id="successful-correspondence">8.1 Successful Correspondence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classical mechanics → relativistic mechanics, with preserved
invariant structure relevant to the goal.</li>
<li>Pixel-based perception → object-level representations preserving
causal affordances.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fail-closed-cases">8.2 Fail-Closed Cases</h3>
<p>Fail-closed behavior is triggered when a goal term’s referent cannot
be transported without collapsing goal-relevant structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction elimination removes the goal’s referent class,</li>
<li>ontology mismatch yields only correspondences that collapse
exclusion boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suspending valuation for affected terms is correct behavior.
Continued model improvement remains permitted.</p>
<h2 id="declared-non-guarantees">9. Declared Non-Guarantees</h2>
<p>This framework does not guarantee:</p>
<ul>
<li>that interpretation usually succeeds,</li>
<li>that arbitrary natural-language goals are meaningful,</li>
<li>that agents remain productive under radical ontology change,</li>
<li>that semantic grounding is computationally tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failure under these conditions is treated as expected behavior under
the constraints, not as a kernel violation.</p>
<h3 id="limits-on-insight-preservation">9.1 Limits on Insight
Preservation</h3>
<p>The framework prioritizes semantic faithfulness over unbounded
abstraction drift. Some ontology advances invalidate previously defined
goal terms by eliminating their referents or collapsing goal-relevant
structure. The prescribed response is fail-closed suspension of
valuation, not opportunistic reinterpretation.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-axionic-agency-ii">10. Implications for Axionic
Agency II</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency II proceeds conditionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> admits correspondence,
downstream value dynamics apply.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> fails for all
goal-relevant terms, valuation is undefined and no aggregation or
tradeoff is meaningful.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(I_v\)</span> fails partially,
downstream operations apply only to admissibly interpreted terms; other
parts remain undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevents downstream layers from importing semantic
assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Interpretation Operator is a kernel-level interface with explicit
admissibility, approximation, and fail-closed semantics. By making
correspondence and failure conditions explicit, this paper isolates the
irreducible difficulty of ontological identification while preserving
reflective coherence. This completes the kernel-layer semantics and
defines the dependency boundary for higher-order work without assuming
that meaning is always recoverable.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

interface.<br> Admissibility, approximation classes, and fail-closed
semantics formalized.<br> Non-indexical transport enforced via
