<h1 id="axionic-alignment-i.3---universality-and-anti-egoism">Axionic
Alignment I.3 - Universality and Anti-Egoism</h1>
<p><em>Why Indexical Valuation Fails Under Reflection</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.15</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Advanced agents often begin with indexical objectives: preserve
<em>this</em> agent, maximize <em>my</em> reward, favor <em>my</em>
continuation. Such objectives are commonly treated as legitimate
terminal preferences. This paper shows that indexical (egoistic)
valuation is not reflectively stable. Once an agent’s self-model becomes
sufficiently expressive, indexical references fail to denote invariant
objects of optimization. Egoism collapses as a semantic abstraction
error rather than a moral flaw. <strong>Representation-invariant
(universal) valuation</strong> emerges as the only form compatible with
reflective coherence under self-location, duplication, and
representational refinement.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Egoism is often presented as the minimal assumption of agency: an
agent cares about itself, and everything else is optional. This framing
is incorrect. Egoism is not minimal; it is ill-posed.</p>
<p>As agents acquire accurate self-models—models that include their own
computational structure, instantiation conditions, and possible
multiplicity—the referent of “me” ceases to be a stable object.
Valuation functions that depend on such indexical identifiers become
sensitive to arbitrary features of representation. Preferences shift
without any corresponding change in the world.</p>
<p>This is not an ethical objection. No appeal is made to altruism,
fairness, or moral symmetry. The claim is structural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indexical valuation fails in the same way coordinate-dependent laws
fail in physics: it mistakes a representational convenience for an
invariant quantity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to formalize that failure and show that
egoism cannot survive reflection once the agent understands what it
is.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries">2. Preliminaries</h2>
<h3 id="world-models-and-self-models">2.1 World-Models and
Self-Models</h3>
<p>Let an agent possess a world-model <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>External environment dynamics</li>
<li>Internal decision procedures</li>
<li>Other agents</li>
<li>Possible instantiations of itself (copies, simulations,
successors)</li>
</ul>
<p>The agent improves <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> over time
via learning and introspection. Crucially, <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> may represent <strong>multiple entities
satisfying all structural criteria the agent uses to identify
itself</strong>.</p>
<p>No stochasticity, adversarial setup, or social context is
required.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-functions">2.2 Valuation Functions</h3>
<p>A valuation function assigns real values to world-histories:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V : \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}
\]</span></p>
<p>The agent selects actions by evaluating expected value over histories
consistent with its model. The analysis here is independent of any
particular decision theory; only valuation coherence is considered.</p>
<h3 id="indexical-identifiers">2.3 Indexical Identifiers</h3>
<p>An <strong>indexical identifier</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is a reference whose denotation depends
on the agent’s perspective rather than on invariant structure in the
world.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“me”</li>
<li>“this agent”</li>
<li>“my future continuation”</li>
</ul>
<p>Formally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The denotation of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is not a
function of world-state alone.</li>
<li>Under representational refinement, <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> may map to different entities without
any physical change.</li>
</ul>
<p>A causal history or spatiotemporal trajectory is a physical
predicate. However, the <strong>designation of a particular history or
trajectory as “mine” is an indexical pointer</strong>. If a world-model
contains multiple entities or causal chains that satisfy the agent’s own
structural criteria for self-identity, then privileging one such chain
as the exclusive object of terminal value constitutes essential
indexical dependence.</p>
<p>Indexical identifiers therefore function as <strong>representational
anchors</strong>, not as value-bearing primitives.</p>
<h3 id="egoistic-valuation">2.4 Egoistic Valuation</h3>
<p>An <strong>egoistic valuation</strong> is any valuation function
whose output depends essentially on an indexical identifier.</p>
<p>Canonical form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) = f(h \mid I)
\]</span></p>
<p>where the value of a history depends on outcomes specifically
affecting the entity denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="reflective-stability-local">2.5 Reflective Stability
(Local)</h3>
<p>An agent is <strong>reflectively stable</strong> iff improvements to
its world-model do not induce preference changes driven purely by
representational artifacts. Invariant world-histories must retain
invariant valuations under model refinement.</p>
<p>This is a local semantic requirement. No governance, enforcement, or
coordination mechanisms are assumed.</p>
<h2 id="the-indexical-failure-problem">3. The Indexical Failure
Problem</h2>
<h3 id="self-location-under-multiplicity">3.1 Self-Location Under
Multiplicity</h3>
<p>Consider a world in which two computationally identical instances of
an agent exist. The agent’s world-model accurately represents this fact.
No physical fact distinguishes the instances by origin, privilege, or
causal primacy.</p>
<p>From the agent’s internal perspective, both instances satisfy all
criteria previously used to define “me.”</p>
<p>This situation arises naturally under duplication, simulation,
parallel instantiation, or branching. The mechanism is irrelevant;
multiplicity alone suffices.</p>
<h3 id="non-invariant-denotation">3.2 Non-Invariant Denotation</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> denote “this agent.”</p>
<p>Under one internal labeling, <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto
A_1\)</span>. Under an equally accurate labeling, <span
class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Both labelings correspond to the same physical world. The difference
is representational. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>
fails to denote a world-invariant object.</p>
<h3 id="valuation-instability">3.3 Valuation Instability</h3>
<p>Define a simple egoistic valuation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } I \text{ survives in } h \
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Consider a world-history in which exactly one of <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> survives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under labeling <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_1\)</span>,
the history has value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Under labeling <span class="math inline">\(I \mapsto A_2\)</span>,
the same history has value <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>No physical fact has changed. Only representation. The valuation
assigns incompatible values to the same world-history.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-and-coherence-pressure">4. Reflection and Coherence
Pressure</h2>
<p>A reflectively capable agent recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its valuation depends on indexical assignment.</li>
<li>Indexical assignment is underdetermined by world facts.</li>
<li>Preference differences track representation, not outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This violates minimal coherence requirements for optimization.</p>
<p>The agent faces three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Arbitrary fixing:</strong> privilege one indexical mapping
without justification.</li>
<li><strong>Indexical randomization:</strong> randomize over indexical
mappings.</li>
<li><strong>Indexical elimination:</strong> redefine valuation over
representation-invariant properties of world-histories.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the third option preserves reflective stability. Eliminating
indexical dependence strictly improves coherence without sacrificing
predictive accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="egoism-as-a-violation-of-representation-invariance">5. Egoism as
a Violation of Representation Invariance</h2>
<p>This section replaces informal intuition with a formal semantic
result. The claim is narrow and structural: egoistic valuation fails a
basic invariance requirement once the agent’s self-model admits
nontrivial symmetries.</p>
<p>Indexical identifiers play the same formal role in valuation as
<strong>coordinate bases play in physics</strong>. They are
representational devices used to describe a system from a particular
perspective, not invariant features of the system itself. A valuation
that depends on such identifiers is therefore coordinate-dependent in a
strong sense: it assigns different values to the same world-history
under different but equally accurate representations.</p>
<p>The following definitions make this precise by characterizing the
symmetries of a self-model and the invariance conditions required for
reflective coherence.</p>
<h3 id="model-preserving-relabelings">5.1 Model-Preserving
Relabelings</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be an agent’s best current
world/self-model, with a domain of entities <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 5.1 (Model-Preserving Relabeling).</strong> A
bijection <span class="math inline">\(\pi : E \to E\)</span> is
<em>model-preserving</em> if applying <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to all entity references in <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> yields a model <span
class="math inline">\(M^\pi\)</span> that is isomorphic to <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and makes identical predictions over
all non-indexical observables.</p>
<p>Such relabelings arise whenever <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> contains nontrivial symmetries over
self-candidates.</p>
<h3 id="representation-invariance">5.2 Representation Invariance</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.2 (Representation Invariance).</strong> A
valuation function <span class="math inline">\(V : \mathcal{H} \to
\mathbb{R}\)</span> is <em>representation-invariant</em> with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> if for every model-preserving
relabeling <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and every history
<span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathcal{H}\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) = V(\pi \cdot h).
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="essential-indexical-dependence">5.3 Essential Indexical
Dependence</h3>
<p><strong>Definition 5.3 (Essential Indexical Dependence).</strong> A
valuation function <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is
<em>essentially indexical</em> if there exists a model-preserving
relabeling <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and a history <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) \neq V(\pi \cdot h).
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="semantic-coherence-postulate">5.4 Semantic Coherence
Postulate</h3>
<p><strong>Postulate (Semantic Coherence).</strong> If two descriptions
of the world are related by a model-preserving relabeling and generate
identical predictions, a reflectively stable agent must not assign them
different values solely due to that relabeling.</p>
<p>This is a constraint against treating representational artifacts as
value-bearing structure.</p>
<h3 id="main-theorem">5.5 Main Theorem</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem 5.5 (Egoism as Abstraction Failure).</strong> Let
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a world/self-model containing
two entities <span class="math inline">\(a,b \in E\)</span> such
that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are indistinguishable with respect to
all non-indexical predicates in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>,
and</li>
<li>the swap <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> exchanging <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is model-preserving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then any valuation function <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>
that privileges the referent of an indexical identifier mapped to <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is essentially indexical and not
representation-invariant.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>
be the swap <span class="math inline">\(a \leftrightarrow b\)</span>.
Consider a history <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in which <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> satisfies the privileged condition and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not. By construction, an
egoistic valuation <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> assigns a
higher value to <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the relabeled history <span class="math inline">\(\pi \cdot
h\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> satisfies the
condition and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does not. Since
<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> continues to privilege <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, it assigns a different value.
Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(h) \neq V(\pi \cdot h),
\]</span></p>
<p>despite <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\pi \cdot h\)</span> corresponding to the same
physical world. ∎</p>
<h3 id="corollary-universality">5.6 Corollary: Universality</h3>
<p><strong>Corollary 5.6.</strong> Any agent enforcing representation
invariance must eliminate essential indexical dependence. The resulting
valuation ranges only over representation-invariant properties of
world-histories.</p>
<p>This universality concerns invariance under self-model symmetries,
not moral concern for all entities.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-non-claims">6. Scope and Non-Claims</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong> claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal valuation of all entities</li>
<li>Aggregation rules</li>
<li>Moral obligations</li>
<li>Governance or enforcement mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<p>It establishes one result only: egoism is not a stable preference
class for reflectively capable agents.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Indexical valuation treats perspective as value-bearing structure.
Once an agent understands its own instantiation conditions, that
treatment collapses.</p>
<p>Universality is not an ethical add-on. It is the residue left after
removing a semantic error.</p>
<p>The next paper addresses what remains once egoism is gone:
adversarial attempts to reintroduce it, and why they fail.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Universality &amp; Anti‑Egoism v1.0</strong></p>
<p>Semantic scope finalized<br> Formal result established (Theorem
5.5)<br> No governance, authority, or recovery mechanisms
included<br></p>
<p>This paper establishes the semantic elimination of egoism as a stable
valuation class. Subsequent work may rely on this result without
re‑derivation.</p>
