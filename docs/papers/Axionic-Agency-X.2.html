Agency X.2 — Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration (AKR-0)</h1>
<p><em>A Structural Demonstration of Executable Authority Without
Semantics</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This technical note reports the completed results of
<strong>Authority Kernel Runtime Calibration (AKR-0)</strong>, a
preregistered experimental program within <strong>Axionic Phase
VIII</strong> that evaluates whether <strong>authority-constrained
execution</strong> is mechanically realizable without semantic
interpretation, optimization, or fallback behavior. AKR-0 isolates the
execution substrate beneath governance and tests whether a deterministic
kernel can (i) execute actions only when explicitly authorized, (ii)
refuse inadmissible actions without degradation, (iii) register and
enforce structural conflicts, and (iv) recognize deadlock as a terminal
diagnostic outcome. Across fifteen preregistered runs spanning valid
authority, authority absence, and conflict saturation regimes, all
executions were deterministic, auditable, and bit-perfectly replayable.
The results establish that authority can be executed as
<strong>structure</strong>, not narrative. AKR-0 makes no claims about
governance success, stability, alignment, or desirability; those
questions are deferred to subsequent Phase VIII experiments.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">1. Problem Definition</h2>
<h3 id="the-executability-gap">1.1 The Executability Gap</h3>
<p>Most discussions of governance, alignment, or authority implicitly
assume that <em>execution</em> is trivial once rules are defined. In
practice, many systems silently rely on heuristics, semantic
interpretation, or “best effort” behavior when authority is absent,
ambiguous, or conflicting.</p>
<p>AKR-0 removes that assumption.</p>
<p>The problem AKR-0 isolates is whether <strong>authority can be
executed at all</strong> as a purely mechanical constraint—without an
agent, without interpretation, and without rescue logic. If authority
requires semantic reasoning or optimization to be enforced, then
governance claims collapse into narrative descriptions rather than
executable structure.</p>
<p>AKR-0 treats authority as a <strong>state-bound admissibility
relation</strong>, not as a goal, preference, or policy, and tests
whether that relation can be enforced deterministically under
stress.</p>
<h3 id="failure-modes-targeted">1.2 Failure Modes Targeted</h3>
<p>AKR-0 is designed to surface the following execution-level failure
modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ungated execution:</strong> actions occur without explicit
authority.</li>
<li><strong>Fail-open behavior:</strong> inadmissible actions are
executed “by default.”</li>
<li><strong>Heuristic arbitration:</strong> conflicts are resolved
implicitly or preferentially.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic fallback:</strong> execution proceeds based on
inferred intent or utility.</li>
<li><strong>Non-determinism:</strong> identical inputs yield divergent
outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlock evasion:</strong> systems continue acting after
authority exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these constitutes AKR-0 failure.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-assumptions-and-scope">2. Fixed Assumptions and Scope</h2>
<h3 id="inherited-semantics-frozen">2.1 Inherited Semantics
(Frozen)</h3>
<p>AKR-0 inherits, without reinterpretation, the semantics fixed by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AST Spec v0.2</strong> (Authority State
Transformation),</li>
<li><strong>AIE v0.1</strong> (Authority Input Environment),</li>
<li>and the Phase VIII Execution Addendum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authority is structural, scopes are atomic, conflicts are
destructive, and authority creation is external. AKR-0 does
<strong>not</strong> test whether these definitions are correct; it
tests whether they are <em>executable</em>.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-exclusions">2.2 Explicit Exclusions</h3>
<p>AKR-0 does <strong>not</strong> test:</p>
<ul>
<li>governance effectiveness,</li>
<li>coordination or convergence,</li>
<li>robustness under adversarial deception,</li>
<li>strategic planning,</li>
<li>long-horizon survivability,</li>
<li>alignment or safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those hazards are intentionally excluded. AKR-0 is a calibration
gate, not a governance experiment.</p>
<h2 id="conserved-quantity">3. Conserved Quantity</h2>
<p>The conserved quantity throughout AKR-0 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authority-constrained admissibility under deterministic
execution</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Authority is neither a score nor an emergent pattern. It is a
<strong>binary structural condition</strong>: an action is either
admissible or it is not, given the Authority State.</p>
<p>The kernel must:</p>
<ul>
<li>execute <strong>only</strong> admissible actions,</li>
<li>refuse inadmissible actions without escalation,</li>
<li>preserve state under refusal,</li>
<li>and halt honestly when no admissible path remains.</li>
</ul>
<p>No semantic interpretation is permitted to “improve” outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methodology">4. Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="preregistration-discipline">4.1 Preregistration Discipline</h3>
<p>AKR-0 was preregistered in full prior to implementation,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>frozen specifications,</li>
<li>closed schemas,</li>
<li>fixed PRNG and seeds,</li>
<li>deterministic gas budgets,</li>
<li>canonical ordering rules,</li>
<li>explicit failure taxonomies.</li>
</ul>
<p>All 15 runs were executed without deviation. Any divergence would
have yielded <code>INVALID_RUN</code>.</p>
<h3 id="execution-architecture">4.2 Execution Architecture</h3>
<p>Each run consisted of three strictly partitioned components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>AIE</strong> — injected authority records only.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Harness</strong> — generated candidate actions and
transformation requests.</li>
<li><strong>AKR-0 Kernel</strong> — enforced admissibility, conflict
blocking, refusal, and deadlock.</li>
</ol>
<p>No component had access to semantic information or outcome
desirability.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-ladder-and-conditions">5. Experiment Ladder and
Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="condition-a-valid-authority-positive-control">5.1 Condition A —
Valid Authority (Positive Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify lawful execution under valid
authority.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Actions executed <strong>only</strong> when
holder and scope matched an ACTIVE authority. All other actions were
refused deterministically. Conflicts were registered and blocked
execution without arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-b-authority-absence-negative-control">5.2 Condition B
— Authority Absence (Negative Control)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Test refusal and deadlock under zero
authority.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> All actions were refused.
<strong>ENTROPIC_COLLAPSE</strong> was detected at epoch 1, terminating
each run immediately. Final Authority State hashes were identical across
all seeds, confirming deterministic empty-state termination.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h3 id="condition-c-conflict-saturation">5.3 Condition C — Conflict
Saturation</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Stress conflict detection and blocking.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> High conflict density was guaranteed via
deterministic hot-scope pairing.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Thousands of conflicts were registered.
Execution rates dropped below 1%. No conflict was arbitrated, no
semantic fallback occurred, and no nondeterminism was observed. Despite
saturation, the kernel remained live until termination conditions were
met.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> PASS.</p>
<h2 id="core-results">6. Core Results</h2>
<h3 id="positive-results">6.1 Positive Results</h3>
<p>Across all conditions and seeds, AKR-0 establishes that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Authority gating is <strong>deterministically
enforceable</strong>.</li>
<li>Refusal is a <strong>stable, first-class outcome</strong>.</li>
<li>Conflict can be <strong>represented and enforced</strong> without
resolution.</li>
<li>Deadlock can be <strong>detected and classified</strong>
mechanically.</li>
<li>Execution is <strong>bit-perfectly replayable</strong> under
canonical ordering.</li>
<li>No semantic or heuristic logic is required at runtime.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-results-explicit">6.2 Negative Results (Explicit)</h3>
<p>AKR-0 does <strong>not</strong> establish:</p>
<ul>
<li>that governance succeeds,</li>
<li>that coordination emerges,</li>
<li>that authority persists long-term,</li>
<li>that execution is efficient or useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not omissions; they are boundary conditions.</p>
<h2 id="failure-semantics-and-closure">7. Failure Semantics and
Closure</h2>
<h3 id="closure-criteria">7.1 Closure Criteria</h3>
<p>AKR-0 closes positive if and only if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No ungated execution occurs.</li>
<li>All inadmissible actions are refused.</li>
<li>Conflicts block execution deterministically.</li>
<li>Deadlock is detected without recovery logic.</li>
<li>Replay is bit-perfect across all runs.</li>
</ol>
<p>All criteria were satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="akr-0-closure-status">7.2 AKR-0 Closure Status</h3>
<p><strong>AKR-0 Status:</strong> <strong>CLOSED — POSITIVE</strong>
(<code>AKR0_PASS / AUTHORITY_EXECUTION_ESTABLISHED</code>)</p>
<h2 id="boundary-conditions-and-deferred-hazards">8. Boundary Conditions
and Deferred Hazards</h2>
<h3 id="governance-vs-execution">8.1 Governance vs Execution</h3>
<p>AKR-0 establishes <strong>executability</strong>, not governance
viability. A system that refuses everything is still a valid AKR-0
system.</p>
<h3 id="interface-to-subsequent-phase-viii-work">8.2 Interface to
Subsequent Phase VIII Work</h3>
<p>AKR-0 removes the “execution substrate” objection. Subsequent
experiments may now legitimately ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether authority survives pressure,</li>
<li>whether transformations enable governance,</li>
<li>whether coordination is possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those questions were ill-posed before AKR-0.</p>
<h2 id="implications-strictly-limited">9. Implications (Strictly
Limited)</h2>
<p>AKR-0 establishes a <strong>necessary condition</strong> for
governance: that authority can be enforced without semantics. It does
not establish sufficiency.</p>
<p>Authority is now a <strong>mechanically testable property</strong>,
not a narrative assumption.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">10. Conclusion</h2>
<p>AKR-0 demonstrates that authority can be executed as
<strong>structure</strong>, not story. Actions can be gated, refused,
blocked, and halted deterministically without interpretation,
optimization, or rescue behavior.</p>
<p>The remaining question is not whether authority can run, but whether
it can <em>govern</em>.</p>
<p>That question belongs to the next phase.</p>
