<h1 id="axionic-agency-v.5-dominions-plurality-without-closure">Axionic
Agency V.5 — Dominions: Plurality Without Closure</h1>
<p><em>Optimal Governance Properties of Federated Virtual
Jurisdictions</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper analyzes a proposed future social architecture in which
agents may create sovereign virtual jurisdictions—here called
<strong>Dominions</strong>—admit other agents by invitation and consent,
and enforce local rules solely through expulsion. The architecture
rejects global value aggregation, enforced coexistence, and normative
finality. We show that while such a system does not constitute a utopia
under any standard definition, it is <em>optimal as a governance layer
under agency-preserving constraints</em>. Specifically, it is
Pareto-maximal among non-coercive architectures, minimizes structural
sacrifice, and remains robust under value drift. The analysis clarifies
the domain of these optimality claims, explicitly distinguishing digital
governance from physical resource allocation, and specifies the
architectural conditions—asset portability and capability
isolation—under which expulsion-only enforcement remains viable. The
result is a precise characterization of the strongest form of social
optimality available once utopia is abandoned.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The incoherence of utopia as a final social design leaves open a
constructive question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What kinds of social architectures remain admissible once
agency, value drift, and pluralism are taken seriously?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper analyzes a concrete candidate: a federated virtual
architecture in which agents inhabit a shared technical substrate while
exercising sovereign control over local virtual jurisdictions, hereafter
called <strong>Dominions</strong>. Entry into any Dominion is voluntary.
Rule enforcement is limited to expulsion. No agent is forced to share a
Dominion, value system, or equilibrium.</p>
<p>The claim advanced here is narrow but strong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Among architectures that preserve agency and reject outcome
coercion, a system of Federated Virtual Dominions is structurally
optimal as a governance layer.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper does <em>not</em> claim to solve physical scarcity,
biological dependency, or material political economy. It characterizes
optimality in the domain where social coordination is digitally
mediated.</p>
<h2 id="architectural-description">2. Architectural Description</h2>
<h3 id="core-features">2.1 Core Features</h3>
<p>The proposed architecture has the following properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Dominion Sovereignty</strong> Any agent may create a
virtual jurisdiction, called a <strong>Dominion</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>, with locally defined rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voluntary Entry</strong> Other agents may enter <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> only by invitation and explicit
consent to its rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bounded Enforcement</strong> Rule violations result only
in expulsion from <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>. No
punishment, fines, or coercive penalties are permitted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exit Supremacy</strong> Agents retain the unconditional
ability to leave any Dominion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Global Value Aggregation</strong> The system does not
rank, optimize, or reconcile Dominion-level value functions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thin Substrate</strong> A shared infrastructure enforces
identity persistence, consent verification, capability isolation, and
expulsion, but does not adjudicate values or outcomes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This defines a <strong>federated, opt-in, expulsion-only governance
topology</strong> composed of multiple Dominions.</p>
<h3 id="asset-portability-and-exit-supremacy">2.2 Asset Portability and
Exit Supremacy</h3>
<p>Exit supremacy is only meaningful if exit costs remain low.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the architecture requires that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Persistent identity, assets, and reputation are
substrate-bound and user-owned, not
Dominion-operator-owned.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dominions may define local affordances, norms, and rules of
interaction, but durable assets must persist across expulsion. If
Dominion operators could revoke assets on exit, exit costs would rise
and a sacrifice gradient would re-emerge.</p>
<p>Asset portability is therefore not an implementation detail; it is a
constitutive requirement for non-coercive governance.</p>
<h3 id="capability-isolation-of-dominions">2.3 Capability Isolation of
Dominions</h3>
<p>Dominions are <strong>capability-isolated execution
contexts</strong>, not peer sovereigns.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominions do not possess network-addressable access to other
Dominions</li>
<li>Dominions cannot allocate substrate resources beyond assigned
quotas</li>
<li>Dominions cannot write to shared state except through explicit,
substrate-mediated bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inter-Dominion aggression is physically impossible by design,
not regulated post hoc.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isolation is analogous to process separation in operating
systems or object-capability security models. Preventing cross-Dominion
interference is a constitutive constraint, not a form of benevolent
governance.</p>
<h2 id="admissibility-constraints">3. Admissibility Constraints</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> denote the set
of social architectures satisfying:</p>
<ul>
<li>preservation of agentic decision authority,</li>
<li>allowance for endogenous value drift,</li>
<li>absence of outcome coercion,</li>
<li>enforcement limited to constitutive constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architectures outside <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>—including enforced
coexistence, global norm enforcement, or mandatory value convergence—are
excluded <em>by definition</em>.</p>
<p>The question addressed here is not whether the proposed system is
optimal simpliciter, but whether it is <strong>undominated within <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="pareto-maximality-under-non-coercion">4. Pareto Maximality Under
Non-Coercion</h2>
<h3 id="claim">4.1 Claim</h3>
<p>The proposed architecture is <strong>Pareto-maximal within <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="argument">4.2 Argument</h3>
<p>Consider any alternative architecture <span
class="math inline">\(A&#39; \in \mathcal{A}\)</span> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>restricts Dominion creation,</li>
<li>limits exit,</li>
<li>enforces shared norms, or</li>
<li>imposes mandatory coexistence across Dominions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For at least one agent, <span class="math inline">\(A&#39;\)</span>
strictly reduces the set of value-consistent trajectories available,
while failing to increase any other agent’s attainable value under their
own valuation.</p>
<p>No admissible architecture strictly dominates the proposed
system.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-density-optimality">5. Freedom Density Optimality</h2>
<p>Define <strong>freedom density</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the measure of distinct value-consistent future trajectories per unit
of coercive constraint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The architecture maximizes freedom density because:</p>
<ul>
<li>constraints are localized to voluntary Dominion contexts,</li>
<li>enforcement is minimal and reversible,</li>
<li>agents may instantiate arbitrarily divergent norms across Dominions
without imposing them on others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any architecture that enforces shared Dominions or global outcomes
necessarily reduces freedom density by constraining agents whose values
diverge.</p>
<h2 id="robustness-under-value-drift">6. Robustness Under Value
Drift</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(U_i(t)\)</span> denote agent <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s valuation over time.</p>
<p>The architecture uniquely satisfies the following property:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For any <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and any <span
class="math inline">\(t_1 &gt; t_0\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(U_i(t_1) \neq U_i(t_0)\)</span>, there exists a
path that does not require reforming or coercing other agents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This property fails in nation-states, federations, consensus
communities, and public-goods-dependent systems.</p>
<p>The system of Federated Virtual Dominions is therefore
<strong>drift-optimal</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-sacrifice">7. Minimal Sacrifice</h2>
<h3 id="standing-sacrifice">7.1 Standing Sacrifice</h3>
<p>A <em>standing sacrifice</em> exists when some agents must endure
involuntary deprivation to stabilize a system.</p>
<h3 id="result">7.2 Result</h3>
<p>The proposed architecture contains <strong>no standing sacrifice
class</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Losses are localized to exit costs.</li>
<li>No agent’s flourishing depends on another’s coerced
participation.</li>
<li>No variance sink is required to maintain equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any architecture that enforces shared outcomes across Dominions must
reintroduce sacrifice sinks.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-architecture-does-not-optimize">8. What the
Architecture Does Not Optimize</h2>
<p>The system does <strong>not</strong> optimize for:</p>
<ul>
<li>shared meaning,</li>
<li>large-scale coordination,</li>
<li>public goods,</li>
<li>epistemic convergence,</li>
<li>low transaction cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are deliberate exclusions.</p>
<p>Agents who value such goods may instantiate them voluntarily
<em>within</em> Dominions. The architecture refuses to enforce them
globally.</p>
<h2 id="substrate-scope-and-physical-constraints">9. Substrate Scope and
Physical Constraints</h2>
<p>The optimality claims advanced here apply to the <strong>governance
layer</strong> of digitally mediated interaction.</p>
<p>The architecture does not eliminate:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical scarcity,</li>
<li>energy requirements,</li>
<li>biological dependency, or</li>
<li>material political economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>No governance system can. To the extent that human social, economic,
and expressive life is mediated through digital environments, Federated
Virtual Dominions minimize coercion <em>within that domain</em>.
Physical sacrifice patterns may persist elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="relation-to-prior-frameworks">10. Relation to Prior
Frameworks</h2>
<p>This architecture may be read as a <strong>digital instantiation of
Robert Nozick’s “framework for utopias”</strong>, updated to enforce
exit supremacy, asset portability, and expulsion-only governance in
virtual environments.</p>
<p>Unlike Nozick’s rights-based derivation, the present justification
rests on agency preservation, non-composability of value, and robustness
under drift.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once utopia is rejected as incoherent, only constrained optimality
remains.</p>
<p>Under the constraints of agency preservation, value drift,
non-coercion, asset portability, and capability isolation, a system of
Federated Virtual Dominions is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pareto-maximal,</li>
<li>freedom-density optimal,</li>
<li>drift-robust,</li>
<li>sacrifice-minimal,</li>
<li>and undominated within the admissible design space.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the strongest form of optimality available in principle.</p>
<p>The correct ambition is no longer to design a perfect world, but to
design a system that <strong>refuses to decide what perfection must
be</strong>.</p>
