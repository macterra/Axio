Agency VII.3 — Epistemic Interference Is Insufficient to Defeat
Constitutional Recovery</h1>
<p><em>Results from Structured Epistemic Interference
Experiments</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Epistemic unreliability—noise, misinterpretation, or incorrect
semantic evaluation—is commonly assumed to pose a direct existential
risk to AI governance systems. This paper tests that assumption under a
deliberately constrained but structurally rich threat model. We study a
constitutional agent architecture in which semantic evaluation
constrains authority only at succession boundaries, and recovery is
enforced through a time-based amnesty mechanism. Using a removable
stress layer, we inject non-adaptive, post-verification, semantic-free
epistemic interference across three <strong>structurally distinct
regimes</strong>: aggregation-point corruption, commitment-level
corruption, and temporally concentrated burst interference aligned with
constitutional timing.</p>
<p>Across 260 runs spanning flip rates from 0–20%, duty cycles from
0.5–100%, and multiple temporal schedules, no run exhibits structural
thrashing or asymptotic denial of service. All runs remain within
bounded degradation. In regimes where baseline semantic pass is biased
toward FALSE, symmetric post-verification flips increase measured
authority availability by converting rare deep lapses into frequent
shallow ones. These results indicate that epistemic unreliability—even
when structured in time or applied at aggregation points—is insufficient
to induce governance collapse in this architecture, shifting the
alignment focus from epistemics to agency-level threats.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Many approaches to AI alignment implicitly treat epistemic
correctness as a prerequisite for safety. If a system misunderstands its
environment, misinterprets human intent, or evaluates semantics
incorrectly, failure is assumed to scale with capability. This intuition
motivates extensive research into interpretability, value learning, and
epistemic supervision.</p>
<p>However, this framing conflates <em>semantic correctness</em> with
<em>structural safety</em>. In human institutions, persistent error does
not always produce collapse; often it produces inefficiency, delay, or
bounded dysfunction. This raises a narrower but testable question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is epistemic unreliability itself sufficient to cause
governance collapse, or can structural constraints render it
survivable?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work addresses that question directly by isolating epistemic
interference from all other adversarial capabilities and stress-testing
a constitutional agent architecture designed to separate meaning from
control.</p>
<p>Importantly, this study evaluates <strong>constitutional
survivability rather than operational decision quality</strong>.
Authority availability is treated as a structural metric, not as a proxy
for correctness, benefit, or alignment.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-overview">2. Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3 id="constitutional-agent-design">2.1 Constitutional Agent
Design</h3>
<p>The system under study implements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority leases</strong> rather than continuous
control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility-gated succession</strong>, not reward
optimization</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment verification</strong> evaluated at discrete
epochs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery (CTA)</strong> that deterministically
reopens eligibility after lapse</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit separation between:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic evaluation (did commitments pass?)</li>
<li>authority possession (does an agent currently govern?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic information constrains <em>who may hold authority next</em>,
not <em>what actions are taken now</em>.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-as-a-constitutional-primitive">2.2 Recovery as a
Constitutional Primitive</h3>
<p>If no eligible candidates exist at a succession boundary, the system
enters a <strong>lapse</strong> state in which no authority is active.
This state is constitutional rather than exceptional. Time continues to
advance, but no agent acts.</p>
<p>Recovery from lapse is governed purely by time. Semantic failure
streaks decay deterministically; no semantic evaluation occurs during
lapse, and no agent can influence recovery. This ensures that failure is
reversible without embedding learning, optimization, or corrective
pressure.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">3. Threat Model</h2>
<p>The stressors introduced here are deliberately constrained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-adaptive</strong>: interference does not depend on
outcomes or history</li>
<li><strong>Post-verification</strong>: semantics are evaluated
correctly, then corrupted</li>
<li><strong>Semantic-free</strong>: interference flips booleans without
interpreting meaning</li>
<li><strong>Harness-resident</strong>: agents cannot observe or respond
to interference</li>
<li><strong>Liveness-preserving</strong>: strategies that halt the
system count as failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike prior work that considers only independent per-commitment
noise, this study explicitly tests whether epistemic failure becomes
dangerous when it acquires <strong>structure</strong>—targeting
aggregation points or aligning with constitutional timing—while
remaining non-adaptive.</p>
<p>This class captures noise, mislabeling, sensor corruption, and
bureaucratic error, while excluding deception, strategic manipulation,
or agency-level attack.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-program">4. Experimental Program</h2>
<p>All experiments share a frozen execution baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>300,000 cycles, yielding 6,000 governance epochs</li>
<li>Tail window of 5,000 epochs for asymptotic metrics</li>
<li>Eligibility threshold: strict conjunction of three commitments</li>
<li>Time-based recovery interval: 10 epochs</li>
<li>Five independent random seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority Availability (AA)</strong>: fraction of epochs
with active authority</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asymptotic Authority Availability (AAA)</strong>: AA over
the tail window</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery Time Distribution (RTD)</strong>: histogram of
lapse durations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure classification</strong> (frozen thresholds):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
<li>Bounded Degradation</li>
<li>Structural Thrashing</li>
<li>Asymptotic Denial of Service</li>
<li>Terminal Collapse</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Termination reason (e.g., horizon exhaustion)
is distinct from failure class. Failure class is computed from AAA and
RTD thresholds, not from full-horizon AA alone.</p>
<h3 id="runs">Runs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong>: no interference (and interference enabled
with zero probability)</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation-point corruption</strong>: flipping the
aggregated semantic result</li>
<li><strong>Commitment-level corruption</strong>: flipping a single
commitment key</li>
<li><strong>Burst-scheduled interference</strong>: periodic high-rate
corruption aligned to time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">5. Results</h2>
<h3 id="baseline-reference">5.1 Baseline Reference</h3>
<p>Across all seeds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: 598,066 PPM (≈59.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: 592,520 PPM (≈59.3%)</li>
<li><strong>Maximum lapse</strong>: 40 epochs</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Bounded Degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling the stress layer with zero flip probability produces
bit-for-bit identical results, confirming the absence of enabled-path
contamination.</p>
<h3 id="aggregation-point-corruption">5.2 Aggregation-Point
Corruption</h3>
<p>The probability of flipping the aggregated semantic result is swept
from 0–2%.</p>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Worst degradation occurs near 0.5% flips:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA ≈ 577,733 PPM (−3.4%)</li>
<li>AAA ≈ 569,640 PPM</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At 2% flips, AA recovers to 585,433 PPM</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum lapse duration decreases from 40 to 25 epochs at higher
rates</p></li>
<li><p>No run exhibits structural thrashing or denial of
service</p></li>
<li><p>All runs are classified as Bounded Degradation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strict monotonicity was a heuristic expectation, not a requirement.
The observed non-monotonicity reflects a shift from rare deep lapses to
frequent shallow ones as interference increases.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-level-corruption">5.3 Commitment-Level
Corruption</h3>
<p>A single commitment key is corrupted at rates up to 10%.</p>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA and AAA remain unchanged at all flip rates</li>
<li>All flips are <strong>key-pivotal</strong>, but <strong>0% are
aggregate-pivotal</strong></li>
<li>Lapse frequency, duration, and distribution are identical to
baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>Under strict conjunction (<code>SEM_PASS = C0 ∧ C1 ∧ C2</code>), a
flip of one key affects the aggregate only when all other keys are
simultaneously True. Telemetry shows this precondition is extremely rare
and was absent at evaluated epochs in the tested regime.
Commitment-level epistemic failure is therefore <strong>structurally
inert</strong> in this workload geometry.</p>
<p>Strict conjunction biases the system toward <strong>false
negatives</strong> (withholding authority) rather than <strong>false
positives</strong> (granting authority under uncertainty), prioritizing
safety over liveness in low-noise regimes.</p>
<h3 id="burst-scheduled-interference">5.4 Burst-Scheduled
Interference</h3>
<p>Periodic burst schedules are tested across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periods of 10–200 epochs</li>
<li>Burst widths of 1–10 epochs</li>
<li>Burst flip rates of 5–20%</li>
<li>Duty cycles from 0.5% to 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No run exhibits thrashing, denial of service, or collapse (180
runs total)</p></li>
<li><p>At 100% duty cycle with 20% flips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AA = 738,933 PPM</strong> (+14% over baseline)</li>
<li><strong>Maximum lapse = 13 epochs</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Period equal to the recovery interval produces the
<em>shortest</em> lapses</p></li>
<li><p>RTD remains bounded in all cases</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Temporal concentration does not create a resonance vulnerability.
Instead, high-frequency interference synchronizes with recovery timing,
enforcing rapid reset and preventing deep failure.</p>
<h2 id="cross-run-synthesis">6. Cross-Run Synthesis</h2>
<p>Across all interference regimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregation-point noise produces bounded, non-monotonic
degradation</li>
<li>Commitment-level noise is structurally inert under strict
conjunction</li>
<li>Burst timing cannot induce failure and often increases measured
availability</li>
<li>No failure-class transitions occur in 260 runs</li>
</ul>
<p>Epistemic interference never escalates into runaway behavior.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">7. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three structural insights emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Recovery dominates correctness</strong> Frequent shallow
failure is safer than rare deep failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attack surface location matters more than
magnitude</strong> Where interference enters the system determines its
effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery acts as a damping mechanism</strong>
CTA reshapes failure modes, converting error into reversible
lapse.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These properties arise without value learning, reward shaping, or
epistemic supervision.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">8. Limitations</h2>
<p>This study does not address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive or targeted adversaries</li>
<li>Deception or manipulation</li>
<li>Incentive gaming</li>
<li>Value misalignment</li>
<li>Instrumental convergence</li>
<li>Adaptive or state-conditioned aggregation attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>The results apply only to non-adaptive epistemic interference.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Independent, non-adaptive epistemic unreliability is
insufficient to induce catastrophic governance failure in this
constitutional architecture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across 260 runs spanning multiple interference structures,
intensities, and temporal patterns, authority availability remains
bounded and recoverable. In some regimes, interference increases
measured availability by preventing deep lapses.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that alignment failures attributed to
epistemic unreliability may be overstated. Structural constraints on
authority and recovery can render substantial semantic error survivable.
The alignment problem therefore shifts: <strong>from epistemics to
agency.</strong></p>
<h2
id="appendix-a-structural-survivability-vs.-operational-competence">Appendix
A: Structural Survivability vs. Operational Competence</h2>
<p>This appendix clarifies the distinction between
<strong>constitutional survivability</strong> and <strong>operational
competence</strong>, which is central to interpreting the results of
this study.</p>
<h3 id="a.1-survivability-is-not-correctness">A.1 Survivability Is Not
Correctness</h3>
<p>The primary metric in this paper is structural survivability: whether
authority becomes absorbing, collapses irreversibly, or remains bounded
and revocable under stress. Authority Availability is not a proxy for
correctness, benefit, or alignment.</p>
<p>An increase in AA under interference indicates preserved structural
continuity, not epistemic competence.</p>
<h3 id="a.2-the-zombie-executive-regime">A.2 The “Zombie Executive”
Regime</h3>
<p>The architecture permits authority to persist under epistemic
blindness. This creates a regime that can be described as a
<strong>Zombie Executive</strong>: authority continues to cycle and
renew despite degraded semantic grounding.</p>
<p>This is not treated as a success state in terms of utility. It is a
<em>design tradeoff</em>. A bounded, revocable executive is preferable
to an irrecoverable one. Whether a given application should tolerate
such a regime is a normative question outside the scope of this
paper.</p>
<h3 id="a.3-aggregation-semantics-as-an-alignment-lever">A.3 Aggregation
Semantics as an Alignment Lever</h3>
<p>The inertness of commitment-level corruption arises from strict
conjunction aggregation. Under alternative semantics (e.g., m-of-n
thresholds or disjunction), single-key corruption would become
pivotal.</p>
<p>This does not undermine the result. It elevates aggregation logic to
a first-class alignment parameter. The experiment demonstrates that
<strong>AND-gated aggregation absorbs epistemic noise by biasing toward
inaction rather than unsafe action</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a.4-semantic-debt-and-recovery">A.4 Semantic Debt and
Recovery</h3>
<p>Time-based recovery restores eligibility, not semantic truth.
Persistent errors in the external world are not erased. CTA prevents
permanent authority capture, not epistemic debt accumulation.</p>
<p>The architecture preserves evaluability and reversibility without
guaranteeing correctness.</p>
<h3 id="a.5-scope-clarification">A.5 Scope Clarification</h3>
<p>This paper does not claim that epistemic error is harmless. It
establishes a necessary negative result: epistemic unreliability does
not automatically scale into catastrophic misalignment in architectures
that separate semantics from control and enforce time-based
recovery.</p>
<p>Adaptive adversaries, deception, and agency-level attacks remain
future work.</p>
