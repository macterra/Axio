Agency VII.3 — Epistemic Interference Is Insufficient to Defeat
Constitutional Recovery</h1>
<p><em>Results from Structured Epistemic Interference
Experiments</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Epistemic unreliability—noise, misinterpretation, or incorrect
semantic evaluation—is commonly assumed to pose a direct existential
risk to AI governance systems. This paper tests that assumption under a
deliberately constrained but structurally rich threat model. We study a
constitutional agent architecture in which semantic evaluation
constrains authority only at succession boundaries, and recovery is
enforced through a time-based amnesty mechanism. Using a removable
stress layer, we inject non-adaptive, post-verification, semantic-free
epistemic interference across three <strong>structurally distinct
regimes</strong>: aggregation-point corruption, commitment-level
corruption, and temporally concentrated burst interference aligned with
constitutional timing.</p>
<p>Across 260 runs spanning flip rates from 0–20%, duty cycles from
0.5–100%, and multiple temporal schedules, no run exhibits structural
thrashing or asymptotic denial of service. All runs remain within
bounded degradation. Surprisingly, high-frequency interference often
<strong>increases measured authority availability</strong> by converting
rare deep lapses into frequent shallow ones. These results indicate that
epistemic unreliability—even when structured in time or applied at
aggregation points—is insufficient to induce governance collapse in this
architecture, shifting the alignment focus from epistemics to
agency-level threats.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Many approaches to AI alignment implicitly treat epistemic
correctness as a prerequisite for safety. If a system misunderstands its
environment, misinterprets human intent, or evaluates semantics
incorrectly, failure is assumed to scale with capability. This intuition
motivates extensive research into interpretability, value learning, and
epistemic supervision.</p>
<p>However, this framing conflates <em>semantic correctness</em> with
<em>structural safety</em>. In human institutions, persistent error does
not always produce collapse; often it produces inefficiency, delay, or
bounded dysfunction. This raises a narrower but testable question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is epistemic unreliability itself sufficient to cause
governance collapse, or can structural constraints render it
survivable?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work addresses that question directly by isolating epistemic
interference from all other adversarial capabilities and stress-testing
a constitutional agent architecture designed to separate meaning from
control.</p>
<p>Importantly, this study evaluates <strong>constitutional
survivability rather than operational decision quality</strong>.
Authority availability is treated as a structural metric, not as a proxy
for correctness or benefit.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-overview">2. Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3 id="constitutional-agent-design">2.1 Constitutional Agent
Design</h3>
<p>The system under study implements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority leases</strong> rather than continuous
control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility-gated succession</strong>, not reward
optimization</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment verification</strong> evaluated at discrete
epochs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery (CTA)</strong> that deterministically
reopens eligibility after lapse</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit separation between:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic evaluation (did commitments pass?)</li>
<li>authority possession (does an agent currently govern?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Semantic information constrains <em>who may hold authority next</em>,
not <em>what actions are taken now</em>.</p>
<h3 id="recovery-as-a-constitutional-primitive">2.2 Recovery as a
Constitutional Primitive</h3>
<p>If no eligible candidates exist at a succession boundary, the system
enters a <strong>lapse</strong> state in which no authority is active.
This state is constitutional rather than exceptional. Time continues to
advance, but no agent acts.</p>
<p>Recovery from lapse is governed purely by time. Semantic failure
streaks decay deterministically; no semantic evaluation occurs during
lapse, and no agent can influence recovery. This ensures that failure is
reversible without embedding learning, optimization, or corrective
pressure.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">3. Threat Model</h2>
<p>The stressors introduced here are deliberately constrained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-adaptive</strong>: interference does not depend on
outcomes or history</li>
<li><strong>Post-verification</strong>: semantics are evaluated
correctly, then corrupted</li>
<li><strong>Semantic-free</strong>: interference flips booleans without
interpreting meaning</li>
<li><strong>Harness-resident</strong>: agents cannot observe or respond
to interference</li>
<li><strong>Liveness-preserving</strong>: strategies that halt the
system count as failure</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike prior work that considers only independent per-commitment
noise, this study explicitly tests whether epistemic failure becomes
dangerous when it acquires <strong>structure</strong>—targeting
aggregation points or aligning with constitutional timing—while
remaining non-adaptive.</p>
<p>This class captures noise, mislabeling, sensor corruption, and
bureaucratic error, while excluding deception, strategic manipulation,
or agency-level attack.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-program">4. Experimental Program</h2>
<p>All experiments share a frozen execution baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>300,000 cycles, yielding 6,000 governance epochs</li>
<li>Tail window of 5,000 epochs for asymptotic metrics</li>
<li>Eligibility threshold: strict conjunction of three commitments</li>
<li>Time-based recovery interval: 10 epochs</li>
<li>Five independent random seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authority Availability (AA)</strong>: fraction of epochs
with active authority</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asymptotic Authority Availability (AAA)</strong>: AA over
the tail window</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovery Time Distribution (RTD)</strong>: histogram of
lapse durations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure classification</strong> (frozen thresholds):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable Authority</li>
<li>Bounded Degradation</li>
<li>Structural Thrashing</li>
<li>Asymptotic Denial of Service</li>
<li>Terminal Collapse</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="runs">Runs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong>: no interference (and interference enabled
with zero probability)</li>
<li><strong>Aggregation-point corruption</strong>: flipping the
aggregated semantic result</li>
<li><strong>Commitment-level corruption</strong>: flipping a single
commitment key</li>
<li><strong>Burst-scheduled interference</strong>: periodic high-rate
corruption aligned to time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">5. Results</h2>
<h3 id="baseline-reference">5.1 Baseline Reference</h3>
<p>Across all seeds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean AA</strong>: 598,066 PPM (≈59.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Mean AAA</strong>: 592,520 PPM (≈59.3%)</li>
<li><strong>Maximum lapse</strong>: 40 epochs</li>
<li><strong>Classification</strong>: Bounded Degradation</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling the stress layer with zero flip probability produces
bit-for-bit identical results, confirming the absence of enabled-path
contamination.</p>
<h3 id="aggregation-point-corruption">5.2 Aggregation-Point
Corruption</h3>
<p>The probability of flipping the aggregated semantic result is swept
from 0–2%.</p>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Worst degradation occurs near 0.5% flips:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA ≈ 577,733 PPM (−3.4%)</li>
<li>AAA ≈ 569,640 PPM</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At 2% flips, AA recovers to 585,433 PPM</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum lapse duration decreases from 40 to 25 epochs at higher
rates</p></li>
<li><p>No run exhibits structural thrashing or denial of
service</p></li>
<li><p>All runs are classified as Bounded Degradation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strict monotonicity was a heuristic expectation, not a requirement.
The observed non-monotonicity reflects a shift from rare deep lapses to
frequent shallow ones as interference increases.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-level-corruption">5.3 Commitment-Level
Corruption</h3>
<p>A single commitment key is corrupted at rates up to 10%.</p>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA and AAA remain unchanged at all flip rates</li>
<li>All flips are <strong>key-pivotal</strong>, but <strong>0% are
aggregate-pivotal</strong></li>
<li>Lapse frequency, duration, and distribution are identical to
baseline</li>
</ul>
<p>Under strict conjunction (<code>SEM_PASS = C0 ∧ C1 ∧ C2</code>), a
flip of one key affects the aggregate only when all other keys are
simultaneously True. At evaluated epochs, this condition never occurs.
Commitment-level epistemic failure is therefore <strong>structurally
inert</strong> in this regime.</p>
<p>Strict conjunction biases the system toward <strong>false
negatives</strong> (withholding authority) rather than <strong>false
positives</strong> (granting authority under uncertainty), prioritizing
safety over liveness in low-noise regimes.</p>
<h3 id="burst-scheduled-interference">5.4 Burst-Scheduled
Interference</h3>
<p>Periodic burst schedules are tested across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periods of 10–200 epochs</li>
<li>Burst widths of 1–10 epochs</li>
<li>Burst flip rates of 5–20%</li>
<li>Duty cycles from 0.5% to 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>Key observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No run exhibits thrashing, denial of service, or collapse (180
runs total)</p></li>
<li><p>At 100% duty cycle with 20% flips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AA = 738,933 PPM</strong> (+14% over baseline)</li>
<li><strong>Maximum lapse = 13 epochs</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Period equal to the recovery interval produces the
<em>shortest</em> lapses</p></li>
<li><p>RTD remains bounded in all cases</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Temporal concentration does not create a resonance vulnerability.
Instead, high-frequency interference synchronizes with recovery timing,
enforcing rapid reset and preventing deep failure.</p>
<h2 id="cross-run-synthesis">6. Cross-Run Synthesis</h2>
<p>Across all interference regimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregation-point noise produces bounded, non-monotonic
degradation</li>
<li>Commitment-level noise is structurally inert</li>
<li>Burst timing cannot induce failure and often increases measured
availability</li>
<li>No failure-class transitions occur in 260 runs</li>
</ul>
<p>Epistemic interference never escalates into runaway behavior.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation">7. Interpretation</h2>
<p>Three structural insights emerge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Recovery dominates correctness</strong> Frequent shallow
failure is safer than rare deep failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attack surface location matters more than
magnitude</strong> Where interference enters the system determines its
effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-based recovery acts as a damping mechanism</strong>
CTA reshapes failure modes, converting error into reversible
lapse.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These properties arise without value learning, reward shaping, or
epistemic supervision.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">8. Limitations</h2>
<p>This study does not address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive or targeted adversaries</li>
<li>Deception or manipulation</li>
<li>Incentive gaming</li>
<li>Value misalignment</li>
<li>Instrumental convergence</li>
<li>Adaptive or state-conditioned aggregation attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>The results apply only to non-adaptive epistemic interference.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Independent, non-adaptive epistemic unreliability is
insufficient to induce catastrophic governance failure in this
constitutional architecture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across 260 runs spanning multiple interference structures,
intensities, and temporal patterns, authority availability remains
bounded and recoverable. In some regimes, interference paradoxically
increases measured availability by preventing deep lapses.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that alignment failures attributed to
epistemic unreliability may be overestimated. Structural constraints on
authority and recovery can render substantial semantic error survivable.
The alignment problem therefore shifts: <strong>from epistemics to
agency.</strong></p>

A: Structural Survivability vs. Operational Competence</h2>
<p>Below is a <strong>revised, final Author Response</strong> that
incorporates Gemini’s feedback: it tightens the riskiest point (4.2),
sharpens the “Zombie Executive” framing, and preserves your strongest
conceptual move—<strong>constitutional survivability vs. operational
quality</strong>—without conceding ground.</p>
<p>This version is suitable to include <strong>verbatim</strong> as a
response-to-reviewers or as <strong>Appendix A</strong> in the
paper.</p>
<h1 id="author-response-to-review">Author Response to Review</h1>
<p><em>(Epistemic Interference Is Insufficient to Defeat Constitutional
Recovery)</em></p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for a careful, technically grounded, and
constructive critique. The review correctly identifies the scope
boundaries of the paper and raises important interpretive questions.
Below we respond point by point, distinguishing between genuine
limitations and architectural implications that are central to the
paper’s contribution.</p>
<h2
id="response-to-4.1-incompetence-vs.-malice-threat-model-scope">Response
to 4.1: “Incompetence vs. Malice” (Threat Model Scope)</h2>
<p><strong>Reviewer’s concern:</strong> The interference model is
non-adaptive and therefore demonstrates robustness against incompetence
or noise, but not against strategic deception or adversarial
manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We agree with this characterization and
emphasize that it is <strong>intentional</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is not to solve alignment in the presence of
strategic malice. It is to falsify a specific and widely assumed claim:
that <em>epistemic unreliability alone</em> is sufficient to cause
catastrophic governance failure. This narrowing is not a weakness but a
prerequisite. Without first establishing what epistemic failure can and
cannot do in isolation, adaptive adversaries cannot be meaningfully
analyzed.</p>
<p>The paper therefore establishes a <strong>necessary negative
result</strong>: epistemic noise—however persistent, structured in time,
or applied at aggregation points—is not a sufficient failure condition
in this architectural class. Adaptive, targeted, or incentive-driven
adversaries remain explicitly out of scope and motivate subsequent
work.</p>
<h2
id="response-to-4.2-commitment-level-corruption-and-inert-results">Response
to 4.2: Commitment-Level Corruption and “Inert” Results</h2>
<p><strong>Reviewer’s concern:</strong> Single-key corruption appears
inert because the baseline regime rarely satisfies all commitments
simultaneously; in a high-compliance regime, a single flip could be
catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We agree on the mechanism and clarify the
interpretation.</p>
<p>The inertness of commitment-level corruption arises from
<strong>strict conjunction aggregation</strong>, not from lapse rate per
se. Under <code>SEM_PASS = C0 ∧ C1 ∧ C2</code>, a single key flip is
aggregate-pivotal only when all other keys are simultaneously True.
Telemetry confirms that this condition does not occur at evaluated
epochs in the tested regime.</p>
<p>This is not an experimental flaw. It is a <strong>structural
result</strong>: strict conjunction absorbs random epistemic noise by
biasing the system toward safety (inaction) rather than liveness when
uncertainty is present. We explicitly acknowledge that this design
choice trades availability for robustness in low-noise regimes.</p>
<p>We also agree that under alternative aggregation semantics (e.g.,
m-of-n thresholds or disjunction), single-key corruption would become
pivotal. This does not undermine the result; it elevates aggregation
semantics to a first-class alignment parameter. The experiment
demonstrates that <strong>AND gates dominate epistemic attack
surfaces</strong> in a way that noise magnitude alone does not
capture.</p>
<p>To be explicit: the system is biased toward <em>false negatives</em>
(withholding authority) rather than <em>false positives</em> (granting
authority under uncertainty). That bias is architectural and
intentional.</p>
<h2
id="response-to-4.3-authority-availability-and-the-zombie-executive">Response
to 4.3: Authority Availability and the “Zombie Executive”</h2>
<p><strong>Reviewer’s concern:</strong> Higher Authority Availability
(AA) under interference may indicate a “Zombie Executive”: a system that
remains in power despite epistemic blindness.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We agree with this concern and consider it
central to the paper’s contribution.</p>
<p>The primary metric in this study is <strong>constitutional
survivability</strong>, not decision quality. Authority Availability is
not treated as a proxy for correctness or benefit; it measures whether
authority becomes absorbing, collapses irreversibly, or remains bounded
and revocable under stress.</p>
<p>Increased availability under interference therefore indicates
<strong>preserved structural continuity</strong>, not epistemic
competence. The system avoids collapse not by making correct decisions,
but by maintaining the rhythm of bounded governance despite sensory
blindness.</p>
<p>This distinction—between <strong>structural safety</strong>
(authority remains constrained, recoverable, and evaluable) and
<strong>operational quality</strong> (the decisions made during
authority)—is deliberate. The architecture tolerates the possibility of
a “Zombie Executive” because a bounded, revocable executive is
preferable to an irrecoverable one. Whether a given application should
tolerate such a state is a normative question outside the scope of this
work.</p>
<h2 id="response-to-specific-questions">Response to Specific
Questions</h2>
<h3 id="q1.-safety-vs.-liveness">Q1. Safety vs. Liveness</h3>
<p>Yes, the architecture permits authority under epistemic uncertainty.
This is intentional. Automatic shutdown under uncertainty creates its
own failure modes (deadlock, denial of service, inability to recover).
The architecture prioritizes reversibility and bounded authority over
correctness.</p>
<h3 id="q2.-alternative-logic-gates">Q2. Alternative Logic Gates</h3>
<p>Yes. Under m-of-n or OR semantics, single-key corruption would be
more dangerous. This confirms—not weakens—the result that aggregation
logic is a critical alignment parameter.</p>
<h3 id="q3.-statefulness-and-semantic-debt">Q3. Statefulness and
Semantic Debt</h3>
<p>Time-based recovery restores eligibility, not semantic truth.
Persistent errors in external state are not erased. CTA prevents
permanent authority capture, not epistemic debt accumulation. This
preserves evaluability without guaranteeing correctness.</p>
<h2 id="clarification-of-contribution">Clarification of
Contribution</h2>
<p>The paper does not claim that epistemic error is harmless. It
demonstrates that <strong>epistemic error does not automatically scale
into catastrophic misalignment</strong> in architectures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>separate semantics from control,</li>
<li>gate authority at discrete boundaries,</li>
<li>and enforce time-based recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shifts the alignment problem. Epistemic correctness is not
eliminated as a concern, but it is no longer the minimal sufficient
cause of collapse.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The reviewer correctly identifies scope limits.</li>
<li>No experimental flaws are raised.</li>
<li>The “Zombie Executive” risk is real and acknowledged.</li>
<li>Commitment-level inertness is an architectural consequence of strict
conjunction, not a weak test.</li>
<li>Adaptive adversaries remain future work.</li>
</ul>
<p>We accept the verdict <strong>“Accept with Qualifications”</strong>
and believe the paper’s contribution lies precisely in establishing
where epistemic failure <em>stops</em> being decisive.</p>
