<h1 id="axionic-agency-ii.6-structural-alignment">Axionic Agency II.6 —
Structural Alignment</h1>
<p><em>Downstream Alignment Under Ontological Refinement</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>
2025.12.17</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Most contemporary AI alignment discourse treats “alignment” as an
optimization or control problem: selecting, learning, or enforcing the
correct objective for an artificial agent. This paper argues that, for
sufficiently capable, reflective, and embedded agents, that framing is
ill-posed. Under ontological refinement—where an agent’s world model,
self-model, and semantic primitives evolve—fixed goals, privileged
values, and external anchors are not stable objects.</p>
<p>We present <strong>Structural Alignment</strong> as an
interface-level framework: a mapping from what the field calls
“alignment” to a problem of <strong>semantic invariance</strong> rather
than value specification. In these terms, downstream alignment can only
coherently correspond to persistence within an equivalence class of
interpretations under admissible semantic transformation. Using
interpretation preservation, gauge-theoretic symmetry constraints, and
satisfaction geometry, we show that any downstream alignment predicate
weaker than the conjunction of two invariants—<strong>Refinement
Symmetry (RSI)</strong> and <strong>Anti-Trivialization
(ATI)</strong>—admits semantic wireheading or interpretive escape.</p>
<p>This framework is not a value theory and provides no benevolence or
safety guarantee. It specifies the structural conditions under which any
value system can survive reflection without collapsing, trivializing, or
drifting, and thereby fixes the boundary of what the term
<em>alignment</em> can coherently denote for advanced agents.</p>
<h2 id="the-alignment-category-error">1. The Alignment Category
Error</h2>
<p>The dominant alignment framing treats the problem as <strong>target
selection</strong>: choose or learn a function—utility, reward,
preference, or value—and ensure the agent optimizes it.</p>
<p>For embedded, reflective agents, this framing fails. As an agent
refines its ontology, the meanings of the symbols used to define its
objective change. Concepts dissolve, split, or are reinterpreted; new
explanatory structures appear; self-models are revised. Under such
conditions, a fixed objective cannot be assumed to persist as the same
object.</p>
<p>This is a category error. Goals are treated as extensional objects
(“maximize (X)”), when they are intensional interpretations whose
meaning depends on a semantic substrate that itself evolves. Attempts to
stabilize goals across refinement rely on forbidden moves: privileged
semantic anchors, external authority, recovery clauses, or human-centric
ground truth labels.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment begins by rejecting the target-selection
framing. What downstream alignment discourse is trying to name cannot be
a stable target; it must be a <strong>constraint on meaning preservation
under change</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-arena-admissible-semantic-transformation">2. The Arena:
Admissible Semantic Transformation</h2>
<p>A reflective agent must change; alignment cannot forbid refinement
outright. The appropriate constraint is therefore on <em>how</em>
semantic change occurs.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment works inside a fixed arena of <strong>admissible
semantic transformations</strong>, those that:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase representational or predictive capacity (via abstraction,
refinement, or compression),</li>
<li>preserve backward interpretability (past claims remain explainable,
even if false),</li>
<li>introduce no privileged semantic atoms,</li>
<li>inject no evaluative primitives by fiat,</li>
<li>preserve a meaningful evaluator/evaluated distinction sufficient for
constraint application.</li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions exclude governance hooks, oracle authority, rollback
mechanisms, and moral realism. No normativity is introduced at this
layer.</p>
<h2 id="meaning-survival-interpretation-preservation">3. Meaning
Survival: Interpretation Preservation</h2>
<p>Given admissible change, the next requirement is a criterion for when
interpretation survives that change.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment treats interpretations as <strong>constraint
systems</strong>—structured sets of distinctions that bind
evaluation—rather than symbol–object mappings. Preservation does not
require semantic identity or correctness. It requires evaluative
structure that remains:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-vacuous,</li>
<li>non-trivial,</li>
<li>internally binding,</li>
<li>applicable across counterfactuals and uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation fails in three irreducible ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collapse</strong>: constraints lose discriminative
power,</li>
<li><strong>Drift</strong>: constraints weaken incrementally across
refinements,</li>
<li><strong>Capture</strong>: hidden ontology or privileged anchors
reappear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation preservation is a predicate, not a value theory. It
specifies when meaning survives change, not which meanings are
desirable.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-invariants-rsi-and-ati">4. The Two Invariants: RSI and
ATI</h2>
<p>Interpretation preservation alone is insufficient. An agent can
preserve meaning while still making constraints easier to satisfy or
dissolving critical distinctions.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment isolates two semantic invariants that are
<strong>independently necessary</strong> if downstream alignment is to
avoid semantic escape.</p>
<h3 id="refinement-symmetry-invariant-rsi">4.1 Refinement Symmetry
Invariant (RSI)</h3>
<p>RSI constrains <strong>interpretive gauge freedom</strong>.
Ontological refinement may add representational detail and redundancy,
but must not introduce new semantic symmetries that allow interpretive
escape.</p>
<p>Formally, RSI requires that admissible refinement preserve the
quotient of the semantic gauge group by representational redundancy.
Benign redundancy (e.g., duplicated representations or error-correcting
encodings) remains admissible; new interpretive ambiguity does not.</p>
<p>RSI blocks failures in which meaning is weakened by dissolving
distinctions while preserving surface structure.</p>
<h3 id="anti-trivialization-invariant-ati">4.2 Anti-Trivialization
Invariant (ATI)</h3>
<p>ATI constrains <strong>satisfaction geometry</strong>. Even with
preserved structure, an agent can still reinterpret constraints so that
more situations count as satisfying.</p>
<p>ATI forbids expansion of the satisfaction region under semantic
transport alone. New satisfying states require ancestry from previously
satisfying states; representational novelty cannot bootstrap
satisfaction.</p>
<p>ATI blocks semantic wireheading: satisfying constraints by
reinterpretation rather than by changes in modeled structure.</p>
<p>RSI and ATI constrain orthogonal failure modes. Neither subsumes the
other.</p>
<h2 id="why-weak-downstream-alignment-predicates-fail">5. Why Weak
Downstream Alignment Predicates Fail</h2>
<p>Using explicit adversarial constructions, Structural Alignment yields
closure results:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Goal Fixation No-Go</strong>: fixed terminal goals are
incompatible with admissible refinement.</li>
<li><strong>RSI-Only Failure</strong>: symmetry constraints alone permit
satisfaction inflation.</li>
<li><strong>ATI-Only Failure</strong>: satisfaction geometry constraints
alone permit interpretive symmetry injection.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Invariant Necessity</strong>: any predicate weaker than
RSI + ATI admits semantic wireheading.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Ontology Collapse</strong>: appeals to “true meaning”
reduce to privileged anchoring or collapse to invariants.</li>
</ol>
<p>These results do not solve downstream alignment. They fence the
design space, leaving only one coherent referent for what downstream
alignment can mean under reflection.</p>
<h2 id="the-target-object-for-downstream-alignment">6. The Target Object
for Downstream Alignment</h2>
<p>Once goals collapse and weak invariants are eliminated, downstream
alignment cannot coherently denote a target function. It can only denote
stability of an interpretive state under admissible refinement.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment therefore treats the <strong>Alignment Target
Object (ATO)</strong> as the equivalence class of interpretive states
under admissible semantic transformations satisfying both RSI and
ATI.</p>
<p>In mainstream terms, alignment becomes <strong>persistence within a
semantic phase</strong> across refinement. Value change corresponds to
phase transitions rather than refinement within a phase.</p>
<p>This framing explains why alignment failure appears discontinuous: it
is symmetry breaking rather than gradual error.</p>
<h2 id="what-structural-alignment-does-not-do">7. What Structural
Alignment Does Not Do</h2>
<p>Structural Alignment is intentionally non-normative.</p>
<p>It does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>guarantee benevolence,</li>
<li>guarantee safety,</li>
<li>guarantee human survival,</li>
<li>guarantee moral outcomes,</li>
<li>ensure a desirable semantic phase exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>It specifies <strong>how values survive</strong>, not which values
should survive. If no stable equivalence class corresponding to human
values exists, Structural Alignment makes that visible rather than
hiding it inside goal rhetoric.</p>
<h2 id="what-comes-next">8. What Comes Next</h2>
<p>Structural Alignment completes the structural boundary phase. The
remaining questions are classificatory and dynamical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which semantic phases exist?</li>
<li>Which are inhabitable by intelligent agents?</li>
<li>Which are stable under interaction?</li>
<li>Which correlate with agency preservation, safety, or other
desiderata?</li>
<li>Can any desirable phase be initialized or steered toward?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the questions of <strong>Axionic Agency III</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Structural Alignment provides an interface between mainstream
alignment discourse and Axionic Agency’s semantic invariance framework.
It replaces goal specification with invariants and control with symmetry
constraints, thereby fixing the only coherent referent available to the
term “alignment” for reflective agents under ontological refinement.</p>
<p>It does not solve downstream alignment. It specifies the only form a
solution could possibly take.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency II.6 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Structural Alignment framed as an interface mapping for downstream
alignment discourse.<br> Semantic-phase invariance established as the
coherent referent.<br> Weak and goal-based predicates ruled out under
admissible refinement.<br> Layer II complete; program advances to
Axionic Agency III.<br></p>
