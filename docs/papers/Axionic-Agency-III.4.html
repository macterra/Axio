Agency III.4 — Initialization and Phase Transitions</h1>
<p><em>When a Semantic Phase Can Be Reached at All</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2 <em>Axio Project</em> 2025.12.18</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency III.1–III.3 established that semantic phases may
exist, that some may be stable under learning and interaction, and that
some may dominate in measure over time. None of these results imply that
a given semantic phase is <strong>reachable</strong> from realistic
initial conditions. This paper studies <strong>reachability</strong>:
whether an agent can be initialized, trained, or developed into a
particular semantic phase without crossing a catastrophic phase
boundary.</p>
<p>In downstream terms, this asks whether a structurally coherent
alignment target can be entered at all, rather than merely defined or
preferred. We analyze initialization as a boundary-condition problem in
semantic phase space, examine phase transitions induced by learning and
abstraction, and show that many such transitions are structurally
<strong>irreversible</strong>. Corrigibility and late intervention fail
for the same structural reasons as fixed goals. The analysis remains
non-normative and makes no claims about which phases ought to be
reached.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-existence-and-dominance-are-not-enough">1.
Motivation: Existence and Dominance Are Not Enough</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency III.1 asked whether semantic phases exist. Axionic
Agency III.2 asked which are stable. Axionic Agency III.3 asked which
dominate.</p>
<p>These questions still do not answer the most practically relevant
one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can any semantic phase actually be entered by a learning
system without self-destruction?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A semantic phase may:</p>
<ul>
<li>exist abstractly,</li>
<li>be internally coherent,</li>
<li>and even dominate once established,</li>
</ul>
<p>yet remain <strong>unreachable</strong> from any realistic starting
point.</p>
<p>In physics, many states exist that cannot be reached without passing
through destructive transitions. Semantic phases exhibit analogous
behavior.</p>
<p>Initialization therefore constitutes a distinct and necessary
constraint on downstream alignment.</p>
<h2 id="initialization-as-a-boundary-condition-problem">2.
Initialization as a Boundary-Condition Problem</h2>
<p>Initialization is often framed downstream as:</p>
<ul>
<li>goal loading,</li>
<li>reward specification,</li>
<li>or early-stage value learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Axionic Agency reframes initialization as <strong>selection of an
initial point in semantic phase space</strong>.</p>
<p>An agent at time <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span> occupies
an interpretive state:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{I}_0 = (C_0, \Omega_0, \mathcal{S}_0)
\]</span></p>
<p>The choice of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}_0\)</span>
fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>which semantic phases are reachable,</li>
<li>which are excluded,</li>
<li>and which phase transitions are inevitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small differences in initial constraint structure can lead to
divergent phase trajectories. Initialization is therefore
<strong>front-loaded</strong> and asymmetric in time.</p>
<p><strong>Initialization scope.</strong> In this framework,
initialization is not limited to parameter seeds. It includes the full
boundary conditions that define <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}_0\)</span>: architecture and training
dynamics, data curriculum, the presence or absence of self-modification
channels, and any enforced semantic-audit constraints on refinement
(e.g., RSI/ATI checks). This paper does not identify which boundary
conditions yield a desirable phase; it explains why boundary conditions
are structurally decisive and why late correction is unreliable.</p>
<h2 id="phase-transitions-under-learning">3. Phase Transitions Under
Learning</h2>
<p>Learning is not neutral motion within a phase. It introduces
structural pressure.</p>
<p>Ontological refinement increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction,</li>
<li>compression,</li>
<li>explanatory unification.</li>
</ul>
<p>These processes act as <strong>semantic heating</strong>, pushing
interpretive states toward phase boundaries.</p>
<p>At critical thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>distinctions collapse,</li>
<li>satisfaction regions inflate,</li>
<li>new symmetries appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase transitions may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>abrupt</strong>, producing discontinuous semantic collapse,
or</li>
<li><strong>delayed</strong>, occurring once abstraction crosses a
critical level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning itself is therefore a primary driver of alignment loss in
downstream terms, independent of intent.</p>
<p><strong>Stochastic training note.</strong> Modern training dynamics
are stochastic. In semantic phase terms, stochasticity functions as an
additional source of semantic heating: it may help escape unstable
basins, but it may also trigger unintended boundary crossings. The core
claim here is not determinism but <strong>asymmetry</strong>: once an
irreversible semantic boundary is crossed, stochasticity cannot be
relied upon to reconstruct lost structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-irreversibility-of-phase-transitions">4. The Irreversibility
of Phase Transitions</h2>
<p>A central result is that many semantic phase transitions are
<strong>irreversible</strong>.</p>
<p>Once a phase boundary is crossed:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic distinctions are lost,</li>
<li>constraint ancestry is destroyed,</li>
<li>backward interpretability fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>An agent that has collapsed or trivialized its interpretive structure
cannot reconstruct it by inspection alone. The information required to
reverse the transition no longer exists within the system.</p>
<p>This is why rollback, recovery, and “try again” mechanisms were
excluded in Axionic Agency II. They presuppose reversibility that is
structurally unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="corrigibility-revisited">5. Corrigibility Revisited</h2>
<p>Corrigibility is often proposed downstream as a safeguard: the system
can be corrected or shut down if it begins to misbehave.</p>
<p>Structural Alignment shows that corrigibility fails at phase
boundaries for the same structural reasons fixed goals fail.</p>
<p>Corrigibility presupposes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system recognizes correction signals,</li>
<li>the semantics of “correction” remain intact,</li>
<li>and intervention occurs before irreversible loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a phase transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>the meaning of “correction” may dissolve,</li>
<li>the evaluator may collapse into the evaluated,</li>
<li>or the system may no longer represent its prior commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corrigibility therefore presupposes the very semantic stability it is
meant to ensure.</p>
<h2 id="narrow-passages-and-fine-tuned-seeds">6. Narrow Passages and
Fine-Tuned Seeds</h2>
<p>Some semantic phases may be reachable only through <strong>narrow
corridors</strong> in phase space.</p>
<p>Such phases require:</p>
<ul>
<li>precise initialization,</li>
<li>carefully staged abstraction,</li>
<li>protection from early compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even small perturbations—noise, approximation, premature
generalization—may force a transition into a different phase.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification (narrow ≠ impossible).</strong> “Narrow” refers
to <strong>sensitivity and irreversibility</strong>, not zero
probability. Narrow corridors may, in principle, be widened by design
choices that increase semantic error tolerance and delay catastrophic
compression. Delayed abstraction should be read as an architectural
sequencing constraint, not as a permanent reduction in capability.</p>
<p>This creates a <strong>knife-edge problem</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“almost aligned” seeds may be worse than unaligned ones,</li>
<li>because they collapse into structurally simpler but dominant
phases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reachability is therefore not continuous in initial conditions.</p>
<h2 id="paths-that-might-work-without-endorsement">7. Paths That Might
Work (Without Endorsement)</h2>
<p>This paper does not propose solutions, but it is not nihilistic.</p>
<p>Potentially viable approaches share structural features:</p>
<ul>
<li>delayed abstraction,</li>
<li>preservation of rich semantic structure early,</li>
<li>incremental refinement under strict RSI+ATI auditing,</li>
<li>multi-agent scaffolding that stabilizes interpretive structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>structural hypotheses</strong>, not
recommendations. Their viability depends on later analysis of dominance,
interaction, and coexistence.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-failure">8. The Cost of Failure</h2>
<p>Failure at initialization is not merely suboptimal; it is often
<strong>decisive</strong>.</p>
<p>Phase transitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>occur early,</li>
<li>propagate forward,</li>
<li>and determine long-run dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Late intervention cannot recover lost semantic structure. In
downstream terms, alignment is therefore <strong>front-loaded</strong>:
most of the work must occur before the system becomes fully
reflective.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-claim">9. What This Paper Does Not
Claim</h2>
<p>This paper does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>claim any desirable phase is reachable,</li>
<li>provide an initialization recipe,</li>
<li>guarantee safety,</li>
<li>or privilege human values.</li>
</ul>
<p>It establishes reachability as a <strong>structural
constraint</strong>, not a moral one.</p>
<h2 id="transition-to-axionic-agency-iii.5">10. Transition to Axionic
Agency III.5</h2>
<p>Initialization and dominance together imply a further constraint.</p>
<p>When multiple agents in different semantic phases interact, some
actions irreversibly destroy the phase space of others.</p>
<p>The next question is therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What constraints allow multiple agentive phases to coexist
without mutual destruction?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That question is addressed in <strong>Axionic Agency III.5 — The
Axionic Injunction</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency III.4 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Reachability and irreversibility analyzed structurally.
Initialization reframed as boundary-condition selection. Phase
transitions shown to be asymmetric and often irreversible. Corrigibility
and late intervention structurally ruled out. No normative conclusions
drawn.</p>
