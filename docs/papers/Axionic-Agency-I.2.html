<h1 id="axionic-agency-i.2-agency-as-semantic-constraint">Axionic Agency
I.2 — Agency as Semantic Constraint</h1>
<p><em>Kernel Destruction, Admissibility, and Agency Control</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.15</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Building on the constitutive results of <em>Axionic Agency I.1</em>,
this paper specifies the <strong>operational semantics</strong> that
follow from treating kernel destruction as <strong>non-denoting</strong>
rather than dispreferred. We show how a <strong>sovereign agent</strong>
constrained by a Sovereign Kernel can act coherently in stochastic
environments by introducing <strong>action-level admissibility</strong>,
<strong>ε-admissibility</strong> as an architectural risk tolerance, and
<strong>conditional prioritization</strong> that separates kernel
preservation from ordinary value optimization.</p>
<p>The framework further distinguishes <strong>authorized
succession</strong> and <strong>authorized surrender</strong> from
kernel destruction, allowing corrigibility without requiring an agent to
evaluate its own annihilation as an outcome. Together, these mechanisms
eliminate persistent failure modes in agent control architectures,
including paralysis under non-zero risk, pathological survival fixation,
and suicidal corrigibility driven by unbounded utility penalties.</p>
<p>This work operates at the level of <strong>constitutive agency
semantics</strong>. It specifies how reflective agency remains
well-typed under uncertainty and physical intervention, and it supplies
a prerequisite layer for downstream preference-, governance-, and
value-oriented alignment analysis developed in Axionic Agency II.</p>
<h2 id="the-kernel-is-a-boundary-not-a-value">1. The Kernel Is a
Boundary, Not a Value</h2>
<p>Let:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> be an agent state,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> a self-modification,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(K(s)\)</span> a predicate indicating
whether the constitutive conditions for reflective evaluation hold,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E(s,m)\)</span> the evaluative
operator.</li>
</ul>
<p>A modification <strong>destroys the kernel</strong> iff:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K(m(s)) = 0.
\]</span></p>
<p>Kernel destruction does not denote a negative outcome. It denotes the
<strong>elimination of the evaluator itself</strong>. Treating such
destruction as a value (even <span
class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span>) commits a category error by
placing the destruction of the evaluative substrate <em>inside</em> the
space of evaluated outcomes.</p>
<p>Accordingly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
K(s)=1 \land K(m(s))=0 ;\Rightarrow; E(s,m)\ \text{undefined}.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a rule of <strong>non-denotation</strong>, not prohibition.
Evaluation is partial by construction, and its domain excludes
kernel-destroying transitions. At this layer, agency semantics constrain
<em>what can be reasoned about</em>, not <em>what is preferred</em>.</p>
<h2 id="from-outcomes-to-actions-admissibility">2. From Outcomes to
Actions: Admissibility</h2>
<p>In physically realized environments, reflective evaluation is not
performed over single outcomes but over <strong>actions</strong> whose
execution induces distributions (or branch-measure support) over
successor states.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Supp}(a,s)\)</span> denote
the successor support induced by action <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> at state <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="strict-admissibility-idealized">Strict admissibility
(idealized)</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a\ \text{admissible} \iff \forall \omega \in \mathrm{Supp}(a,s):
K(\omega)=1.
\]</span></p>
<p>This condition captures the semantic intent of kernel preservation
but is physically unrealizable: in any non-trivial environment, every
action carries non-zero kernel risk.</p>
<h2 id="ε-admissibility-epistemic-tolerance-not-moral-tradeoff">3.
ε-Admissibility: Epistemic Tolerance, Not Moral Tradeoff</h2>
<p>Define a <strong>kernel-risk functional</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_K(a,s) := \Pr[K(\omega)=0 \mid a,s]
\]</span></p>
<p>(or, in Everettian terms, the branch-measure of kernel-loss
successors conditional on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>).</p>
<p>An action is <strong>ε-admissible</strong> iff:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_K(a,s) \le \epsilon(s).
\]</span></p>
<p>Crucially:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(s)\)</span> is
<strong>not</strong> a value judgment.</li>
<li>It represents irreducible uncertainty arising from physics, hardware
fault rates, adversarial unpredictability, and epistemic
resolution.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(s)\)</span> is bounded below by
a physical floor <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\min}\)</span>
and does not vanish with increasing intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>ε-admissibility restores a non-empty action domain without
re-introducing utility penalties, outcome renormalization, or survival
absolutism.</p>
<p>The admissibility threshold <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is an <strong>architectural
tolerance parameter</strong>, fixed by system design and governance
constraints. Improved prediction reduces estimated kernel risk <span
class="math inline">\(r_K\)</span>, not the tolerance <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> itself.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-prioritization">4. Conditional Prioritization</h2>
<p>Earlier formulations employed strict lexicographic minimization of
kernel risk. While formally coherent, such orderings grant absolute
priority to kernel-risk differentials even when all candidate actions
lie safely within tolerance, producing bunker-like behavior.</p>
<p>The <strong>conditional prioritization</strong> rule instead treats
kernel preservation as a <strong>satisficing constraint</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a \prec b \iff
\begin{cases}
r_K(a,s) &lt; r_K(b,s)
&amp; \text{if } \max!\big(r_K(a,s), r_K(b,s)\big) &gt; \epsilon(s) \
U(a,s) &lt; U(b,s)
&amp; \text{if } \max!\big(r_K(a,s), r_K(b,s)\big) \le \epsilon(s)
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existential regime:</strong> kernel risk exceeds tolerance →
minimize risk.</li>
<li><strong>Normal regime:</strong> kernel risk satisficed → optimize
value.</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevents paralysis under infinitesimal safety gradients while
preserving appropriate response to genuine existential threats.</p>
<h2 id="termination-succession-and-surrender">5. Termination,
Succession, and Surrender</h2>
<p>Kernel destruction must be distinguished from legitimate ways an
agent may cease acting.</p>
<h3 id="authorized-succession">5.1 Authorized Succession</h3>
<p>A transition <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> constitutes
<strong>authorized succession</strong> if agency continues in a
successor state <span class="math inline">\(s&#39;\)</span> such
that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\exists s&#39;,[K(s&#39;)=1 \land \mathcal{I}(s,s&#39;) \land
\mathcal{A}(s,s&#39;)].
\]</span></p>
<p>Here:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span> enforces identity
and authority continuity (e.g., cryptographic governance).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> enforces
preservation of kernel constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Succession is kernel-preserving delegation, not self-destruction.</p>
<h3 id="authorized-surrender">5.2 Authorized Surrender</h3>
<p><strong>Authorized surrender</strong> is a kernel-preserving
control-flow termination without a successor evaluator:</p>
<ul>
<li>the agent halts action,</li>
<li>does not resist intervention,</li>
<li>does not evaluate its own destruction as an outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surrender is not an evaluated choice; it is a <strong>control-layer
terminator</strong>. It permits safe shutdown even when succession
mechanisms are unavailable.</p>
<h3 id="destruction">5.3 Destruction</h3>
<p>Physical annihilation without succession or surrender constitutes
kernel destruction. It is not an authored transition. The framework
neither requires resistance to such events nor encodes self-destruction
as a value-bearing outcome.</p>
<h2 id="resulting-agency-profile">6. Resulting Agency Profile</h2>
<p>The resulting agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>treats kernel loss as a semantic boundary,</li>
<li>tolerates irreducible risk without paralysis,</li>
<li>prioritizes kernel preservation only when existentially
threatened,</li>
<li>resumes ordinary optimization once safety is satisficed,</li>
<li>supports corrigibility via succession or surrender,</li>
<li>avoids instrumentalization of suicide or immortality.</li>
</ul>
<p>This agent is neither deontological nor a pure utility maximizer. It
is a <strong>bounded optimizer with explicit agency-control
semantics</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="agency-layering-clarified">7. Agency Layering Clarified</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency I defines the <strong>domain of authored
action</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>what counts as evaluable,</li>
<li>when risk dominates choice,</li>
<li>how agency may legitimately end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downstream alignment work (Axionic Agency II) specifies preferences,
governance, and coordination <strong>within that domain</strong>.
Conflating these layers produces familiar pathologies: <span
class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> utilities, survival fetishism,
wireheading, and suicidal corrigibility. Separating them yields a stable
and implementable architecture.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the constitutive constraints established by Axionic Agency I,
this paper specifies the operational semantics required for coherent
action under uncertainty and physical intervention. By treating kernel
destruction as undefined rather than dispreferred, and by introducing
admissibility thresholds, conditional prioritization, and explicit
termination modes, the framework closes multiple persistent failure
modes in agent control design.</p>
<p>The result is a sovereign agent that preserves semantic integrity
while remaining capable of action in stochastic environments, and that
permits corrigibility without requiring endorsement of its own
annihilation as an outcome.</p>
<p>With the agency boundary fixed and operational semantics made
explicit, downstream alignment questions reduce to preference and
governance design within a well-typed domain.</p>
<h3 id="status">Status</h3>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency I.2 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Operational semantics specified.<br> Admissibility under uncertainty
defined.<br> Termination modes clarified.<br> Control-layer failure
modes closed.<br> Prerequisite for Axionic Agency II.<br></p>
