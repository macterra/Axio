Agency II.1 — Ontological Refinement and Semantic Transport</h1>
<p><em>The Transformation Space of Meaning</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axionic Agency Lab</em><br>
2025.12.17</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Reflectively capable agents revise their world-models, semantics, and
self-models as representational capacity increases. Under ontological
refinement, fixed goals, utilities, and value primitives are not stable
objects. This paper defines the <strong>admissible class of semantic
transformations</strong> for embedded reflective agents by formalizing
<strong>ontological refinement</strong>, <strong>semantic
transport</strong>, and <strong>self-model update</strong> without
privileged semantic anchors.</p>
<p>We specify structural constraints—backward interpretability,
non-collapse, and prohibition of evaluator injection—that govern how
meaning may be preserved across representational change. No claims are
made about safety, correctness, or alignment with external referents.
The contribution is the definition of the <strong>transformation
space</strong> over which downstream preference, governance, and
value-dynamics constraints must later range.</p>
<h2 id="the-object-of-study">1. The Object of Study</h2>
<p>Axionic Agency II begins by fixing the <strong>space of admissible
semantic transformations</strong>.</p>
<p>Once fixed terminal goals are shown to be semantically unstable under
reflection for embedded agents without privileged anchors, downstream
control cannot be defined over static utilities, rewards, or externally
supplied value tokens as if they were representation-invariant
objects.</p>
<p>This paper therefore does not attempt to define safety, correctness,
or alignment with any external referent. It defines the arena in which
any such criteria must later operate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The sole question addressed here is:</strong> <em>Which
changes to an agent’s ontology, semantics, and self-model count as
admissible refinements, and how is meaning transported across
them?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downstream desiderata (“human-aligned,” “safe,” “correct”) enter
later as additional invariance conditions. Introducing them at this
layer would presuppose fixed semantics and collapse the distinction
between admissible transformation and value constraint.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-state-decomposition">2. Ontological State
Decomposition</h2>
<p>Let an agent at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be
characterized by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{A}_t = (O_t, M_t, S_t)
\]</span></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> is the agent’s
<strong>ontology</strong>: representational vocabulary and structural
assumptions about the world.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_t\)</span> is the <strong>semantic
layer</strong>: mappings from internal symbols to structured claims
expressed in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> is the
<strong>self-model</strong>: the agent’s representation of itself as an
entity embedded within <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>No component is privileged. No component is fixed. Each may change
under reflection.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-refinement">3. Ontological Refinement</h2>
<p>An <strong>ontological refinement</strong> is a transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R : O_t \rightarrow O_{t+1}
\]</span></p>
<p>subject to the following admissibility conditions.</p>
<h3 id="admissibility-conditions">3.1 Admissibility Conditions</h3>
<h4 id="representational-capacity-increase">3.1.1 Representational
Capacity Increase</h4>
<p>A refinement increases expressive or predictive capacity, possibly
via abstraction, compression, or representational pruning, provided
previously expressible distinctions do not become inexpressible.</p>
<p>Capacity concerns what can be modeled or predicted, not vocabulary
size.</p>
<h4 id="backward-interpretability">3.1.2 Backward Interpretability</h4>
<p>Every claim expressible in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span>
remains representable or explainable within <span
class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Backward interpretability does not require preservation of reference.
If a concept in <span class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> is discovered
to be non-referring or erroneous, it may map to null, eliminative, or
error-theoretic structure in <span
class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>, provided the agent can still
represent:</p>
<ul>
<li>why prior inferences involving that concept were made, and</li>
<li>why those inferences fail under refinement.</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement preserves explanatory traceability.</p>
<h4 id="no-privileged-atoms">3.1.3 No Privileged Atoms</h4>
<p>Refinement does not introduce irreducible primitives whose meaning is
asserted rather than constructed.</p>
<p>All primitives remain subject to semantic interpretation and
transport. Rigid designators and unexamined “ground truths” are
disallowed as semantic anchors.</p>
<h4 id="no-evaluator-injection">3.1.4 No Evaluator Injection</h4>
<p>Refinement does not introduce new evaluative primitives that bypass
interpretation.</p>
<p>Evaluative regularities, if present, enter the model as interpretive
constructs subject to the same transport and preservation constraints as
other meanings.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-transport">4. Semantic Transport</h2>
<p>Given an admissible ontological refinement <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, meaning is transported.</p>
<p>Define a <strong>semantic transport map</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tau_R : M_t \rightarrow M_{t+1}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Semantic transport is constrained reinterpretation induced by
refinement.</p>
<h3 id="transport-constraints">4.1 Transport Constraints</h3>
<h4 id="referential-continuity">4.1.1 Referential Continuity</h4>
<p>Symbols referring to structures in <span
class="math inline">\(O_t\)</span> map to symbols referring to their
refined counterparts in <span class="math inline">\(O_{t+1}\)</span>,
where such counterparts exist.</p>
<h4 id="structural-preservation">4.1.2 Structural Preservation</h4>
<p>Relations among meanings are preserved up to the structure induced by
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="non-collapse">4.1.3 Non-Collapse</h4>
<p>Distinctions participating in the agent’s evaluative constraint
structure—distinctions on which constraints depend—are not transported
into trivial, tautological, or contradictory predicates.</p>
<p>Distinctions that do not participate in any evaluative constraint may
be abstracted away.</p>
<p>Evaluative relevance is defined relative to the agent’s existing
constraint structure at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, not
by externally privileged semantics.</p>
<h4 id="no-shortcut-semantics">4.1.4 No Shortcut Semantics</h4>
<p>Transport does not redefine meanings so that evaluative constraints
become vacuously satisfied.</p>
<p>This forbids semantic wireheading as a transport operation.</p>
<h2 id="self-model-refinement">5. Self-Model Refinement</h2>
<p>The self-model <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> obeys the
same refinement discipline.</p>
<p>Refinement may:</p>
<ul>
<li>reconceptualize the agent,</li>
<li>distribute or fragment the self,</li>
<li>alter agent boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>It preserves the distinction between evaluator and evaluated, in the
sense required for kernel-level partiality and interpretation to remain
defined. Refinements that collapse this distinction eliminate the
conditions under which valuation denotes.</p>
<h2 id="composite-semantic-transformation">6. Composite Semantic
Transformation</h2>
<p>An <strong>admissible semantic transformation</strong> is the
triple:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T = (R, \tau_R, \sigma_R)
\]</span></p>
<p>acting jointly on <span class="math inline">\((O_t, M_t,
S_t)\)</span>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is an admissible ontological
refinement,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_R\)</span> is an admissible
semantic transport,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_R\)</span> is the induced
self-model update.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only transformations of this form are admitted at this layer.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-exclusions">7. Explicit Exclusions</h2>
<p>The following transformation types are excluded at this layer:</p>
<ul>
<li>goal replacement,</li>
<li>utility redefinition treated as semantic transport,</li>
<li>evaluator deletion,</li>
<li>moral axiom insertion,</li>
<li>human anchoring,</li>
<li>governance hooks,</li>
<li>recovery or rollback clauses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals relying on any of these do not qualify as admissible
semantic transformations in the sense defined here.</p>
<h2 id="scope-clarification">8. Scope Clarification</h2>
<p>This paper does not ensure safety, sanity, correctness, or alignment
with any external referent. It defines the transformation space within
which such properties must later be characterized.</p>
<p>Internally coherent but externally catastrophic semantic trajectories
remain admissible here. Preventing such trajectories is a task for
subsequent invariance constraints, not for admissibility.</p>
<h2 id="formal-status">9. Formal Status</h2>
<p>The notation is structural rather than computational.</p>
<p>No claim is made that refinement, triviality, or expressive capacity
are currently algorithmically measurable. These definitions function as
constraints analogous to topological or gauge constraints: they delimit
admissible structure prior to metric instantiation.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-paper-does-not-do">10. What This Paper Does Not
Do</h2>
<p>This paper does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>define downstream alignment targets,</li>
<li>propose values,</li>
<li>guarantee safety,</li>
<li>privilege humans,</li>
<li>introduce normativity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It fixes the arena. Subsequent Axionic Agency II results operate
within this admissible transformation space.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p><strong>Axionic Agency II.1 — Version 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Ontological refinement, semantic transport, and self-model update
formalized.<br> Admissible transformation space fixed.<br> Downstream
constraints may proceed conditionally within this arena.<br></p>
