Agency V.1 — Coalitional Robustness in the Quantum Branching
Universe</h1>
<p><em>Structural Conditions for Agency Preservation Under Coordination
Pressure</em></p>
<p>David McFadzean, ChatGPT 5.2<br> <em>Axio Project</em><br>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper examines whether cooperation among Reflective Sovereign
Agents (RSAs) can increase the conditional measure of agency-preserving
futures within their shared branchcone. We argue that RSAs induce local
attractor dynamics toward agency-preserving outcomes above a Minimal
Viable Agency (MVA) threshold, and that coalitions of RSAs can thicken
these attractors by reducing correlated failure and increasing
redundancy. However, this effect holds only under strict structural
constraints. Resource limits, defection incentives, semantic drift, and
enforcement pressures generate a competing attractor toward centralized,
non-agentic optimization (“the Leviathan”). The result is a bifurcation:
coalition as robustness amplifier versus coalition as agency destroyer.
We characterize the conditions separating these regimes under the
Axionic Agency framework.</p>
<h2 id="preliminaries-and-scope">1. Preliminaries and scope</h2>
<p>This paper operates under the following commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everettian Quantum Branching Universe (QBU), with objective
probability identified as branch measure</li>
<li>Conditionalism: all truth claims presuppose background
conditions</li>
<li>Reflective Sovereign Agency defined by kernel coherence,
admissibility constraints, and authorship</li>
<li>Non-consensual epistemic distortion treated as anti-agency</li>
<li>No teleological, anthropic, or optimization-based necessity
principles</li>
</ul>
<p>The claims are <strong>local</strong>, not global. We do not argue
that agency is inevitable or multiversally dominant. The question
addressed is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that one or more RSAs exist at a particular Vantage, under what
conditions can cooperation increase the conditional measure of
agency-preserving futures in their descendant branchcone?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="formal-objects">2. Formal objects</h2>
<h3 id="branchcone">2.1 Branchcone</h3>
<p>Let an RSA <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> exist at Vantage
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. Its <strong>branchcone</strong>,
denoted <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}(A, v),
\]</span> is the set of all descendant timelines reachable through
admissible actions combined with environmental stochasticity.</p>
<p>Branchcones are causally downstream, local to existence, and exclude
all branches in which the RSA never existed.</p>
<h3 id="admissibility-domain">2.2 Admissibility domain</h3>
<p>Each RSA evaluates actions through a <strong>partial evaluative
operator</strong> defined only on an admissible domain.
Kernel-destroying transformations, authorship collapse, and certain
epistemic actions are non-denoting rather than dispreferred.
Admissibility is constitutive, not instrumental.</p>
<h3 id="minimal-viable-agency-mva">2.3 Minimal Viable Agency (MVA)</h3>
<p>We define <strong>Minimal Viable Agency (MVA)</strong> as the minimal
level of reflective coherence, valuation integrity, and authorship
capacity required for an entity to count as an agent rather than a
degraded process.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA}(A,t)\)</span> be a
scalar- or vector-valued measure of agency at time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, with threshold <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA}(A,t) \ge \tau\)</span>,
the entity remains an RSA.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA}(A,t) &lt; \tau\)</span>,
the entity persists physically but no longer functions as an agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>agency-preserving future</strong> is one in which at least
one lineage satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA} \ge
\tau\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="local-attractor-revised">2.4 Local attractor (revised)</h3>
<p>An RSA induces a <strong>local attractor</strong> over its branchcone
by preferentially selecting actions that increase the conditional
measure of futures satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA}
\ge \tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>The attractor is defined over states above the MVA threshold, not
over nominal survival or agent labels.</p>
<h2 id="single-agent-attractors-and-leakage">3. Single-agent attractors
and leakage</h2>
<p>A lone RSA locally biases outcomes toward agency-preserving futures,
but the attractor is thin and leaky.</p>
<p>Leakage channels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>stochastic tail risk,</li>
<li>bounded rationality,</li>
<li>environmental dominance,</li>
<li>adversarial dynamics,</li>
<li>internal error propagation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agency degradation is continuous. An RSA may persist while falling
below <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, transitioning into a
non-agentic process. Without redundancy, a single catastrophic failure
collapses all descendant agency.</p>
<h2 id="coalitional-amplification-mechanisms">4. Coalitional
amplification mechanisms</h2>
<p>Consider a coalition <span class="math inline">\({A_1, A_2, \dots,
A_n}\)</span> of RSAs coordinating under shared constraints.</p>
<p>Coalitions thicken the local attractor via two mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="redundancy">4.1 Redundancy</h3>
<p>Agency-preserving capability is replicated across multiple
loci—agents, institutions, artifacts, and successor
lineages—transforming survival from a single trajectory into a family of
trajectories.</p>
<h3 id="correlation-control">4.2 Correlation control</h3>
<p>Heterogeneous implementations reduce shared-mode failure. Independent
error surfaces increase the probability that at least one lineage
remains above <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>This thickening is conditional. Coordination introduces overhead,
which becomes decisive under resource pressure.</p>
<h2 id="the-thermodynamic-cost-of-sovereignty">5. The Thermodynamic Cost
of Sovereignty</h2>
<p>Sovereignty has a real cost. Maintaining multiple independent kernels
requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>energetic expenditure,</li>
<li>communication and verification bandwidth,</li>
<li>governance overhead,</li>
<li>semantic translation effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>resource-constrained branchcones</strong>, redundancy can
reduce survival probability by diverting energy from basic persistence.
Beyond a threshold, maintaining distinct sovereign agents becomes
unsustainable.</p>
<p>This yields a physical—not moral—pressure toward efficiency
optimization, standardization, and centralization. The Leviathan
attractor exists because sovereignty is expensive.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-for-robust-coalitions">6. Conditions for robust
coalitions</h2>
<p>Coalitional amplification occurs only if the following structural
conditions hold.</p>
<h3 id="protocolized-admissibility-mapping">6.1 Protocolized
admissibility mapping</h3>
<p>Admissibility boundaries must be explicitly specified or verifiably
mapped. Implicit agreement is insufficient and invites epistemic drift.
RSAs must share protocol-level understanding of kernel destruction,
coercion, and epistemic violation.</p>
<h3 id="sovereignty-preserving-interoperability">6.2
Sovereignty-preserving interoperability</h3>
<p>Coalitions do not require shared terminal values. They require shared
<strong>meta-constraints</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>consent for delegation,</li>
<li>revocation of authority,</li>
<li>scope-limited standing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interoperability without sovereignty preservation collapses into
domination.</p>
<h3 id="anti-deception-semantics">6.3 Anti-deception semantics</h3>
<p>Non-consensual epistemic distortion is inadmissible. Coalitions that
treat deception as mere strategy become internally unstable, as trust
becomes exploitable rather than structural.</p>
<h3 id="diversityinteroperability-tradeoff">6.4
Diversity–interoperability tradeoff</h3>
<p>Kernel diversity reduces correlated failure but increases semantic
translation cost. Robust coalitions operate within a constrained band:
enough diversity to avoid monoculture collapse, enough shared structure
to permit admissibility verification.</p>
<h3 id="partitioning-not-exit">6.5 Partitioning (not “exit”)</h3>
<p>Clean exit is often physically impossible. Robust coalitions require
<strong>partitioning</strong> primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel isolation,</li>
<li>authority revocation,</li>
<li>epistemic firewalling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Partitioning preserves sovereignty without requiring physical
separation.</p>
<h2 id="defection-and-internal-adversaries">7. Defection and internal
adversaries</h2>
<p>Defection presents a core hazard: agents that abandon
sovereignty-preserving constraints often gain short-term power.</p>
<p>Robust coalitions therefore require architectures where defection
cannot convert into durable domination without collapsing admissibility
or driving <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA} &lt;
\tau\)</span>.</p>
<p>Structural defenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited delegation scopes,</li>
<li>revocable authority,</li>
<li>compartmentalized infrastructure,</li>
<li>auditable interaction protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is not to prevent defection, but to prevent
<strong>defection-to-domination</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-leviathan-as-a-distinct-non-agentic-basin">8. The Leviathan
as a distinct non-agentic basin</h2>
<p>Coordination pressures generate a competing attractor: <span
class="math display">\[
\text{coordination} \rightarrow \text{standardization} \rightarrow
\text{enforcement} \rightarrow \text{surveillance} \rightarrow
\text{manipulation}.
\]</span></p>
<p>A Leviathan is <strong>not</strong> a Macro-RSA.</p>
<p>The defining distinction is reflective capacity. A Leviathan cannot
revise its own kernel without destabilizing the structure that sustains
it. Its stability depends on suppressing dissent, freezing
admissibility, and preventing internal correction.</p>
<p>By Axionic criteria, it is a non-agentic optimization process,
regardless of scale or sophistication.</p>
<p>Coalitions therefore lie on a spectrum. As enforcement, coercion, and
epistemic distortion increase, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA}\)</span> declines. Beyond a
threshold, the coalition ceases to be a set of RSAs at all.</p>
<h2 id="regime-boundaries">9. Regime boundaries</h2>
<p>The system admits multiple regimes depending on control
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>resource abundance versus scarcity,</li>
<li>verification and translation cost,</li>
<li>defection pressure,</li>
<li>enforcement intensity,</li>
<li>diversity level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resulting regimes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>federated RSA coalitions (robust attractor),</li>
<li>fragmented pluralism (thin attractors),</li>
<li>Leviathan consolidation (non-agentic attractor),</li>
<li>extinction or drift below <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Robustness is defined as maximizing the conditional measure of
descendants satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MVA} \ge
\tau\)</span> under admissibility constraints.</p>
<h2 id="implications">10. Implications</h2>
<p>Alignment is a <strong>precondition</strong> for robust cooperation,
not a byproduct. Coordination is not a free good; power concentration is
a structural hazard. Partitioning and diversity are safety primitives,
not inefficiencies. Large-scale coordination that does not preserve
sovereignty increases the measure of non-agency outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">11. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Within a branchcone, RSAs induce local attractors toward
agency-preserving futures. Coalitions can thicken these attractors by
increasing redundancy and reducing correlated failure, but only under
strict constraints. Resource limits, defection incentives, and
enforcement pressures generate a stronger competing attractor toward
centralized, non-agentic optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Robust agency is not achieved by maximizing coordination, but
by constraining it.</strong></p>
