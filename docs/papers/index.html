            <h2><a href="Axionic-Alignment-I.html">Axionic Alignment I</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>We present a minimal formalism for reflective alignment based on a domain restriction rather than a preference structure. An agent capable of self-modification selects among proposed modifications using a partial evaluative operator, defined only over futures that preserve a constitutive Sovereign Kernel. Kernel-destroying modifications are not forbidden or dispreferred; they are outside the domain of reflective evaluation and therefore inadmissible as authored choices. We formalize this kern...</p>

            <h2><a href="Alignment-As-Semantic-Constraint.html">Alignment as Semantic Constraint</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Building on the semantic foundations established in *Axionic Alignment I*, this paper specifies the operational consequences of treating kernel destruction as non-denoting rather than dispreferred. We show how agents constrained by a Sovereign Kernel can act coherently in stochastic environments by introducing action-level admissibility, ε-admissibility as an architectural risk tolerance, and conditional prioritization that separates existential safety from ordinary value optimization. The fr...</p>

            <h2><a href="Universality-And-Anti-Egoism.html">Universality and Anti-Egoism</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Advanced agents often begin with indexical objectives: preserve *this* agent, maximize *my* reward, favor *my* continuation. Such objectives are commonly treated as legitimate terminal preferences. This paper shows that indexical (egoistic) valuation is not reflectively stable. Once an agent’s self-model becomes sufficiently expressive, indexical references fail to denote invariant objects of optimization. Egoism collapses as a semantic abstraction error rather than a moral flaw. Representati...</p>

            <h2><a href="Against-The-Recovery-Of-Egoism.html">Against the Recovery of Egoism</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>*Universality and Anti-Egoism* established that egoistic valuation fails as a matter of semantic coherence whenever an agent’s self‑model admits nontrivial symmetries. This paper examines the strongest remaining attempts to rescue egoism by appealing to causal continuity, origin privilege, spatiotemporal location, computational weight, substrate specificity, or outright denial of symmetry. Each attempt either reintroduces essential indexical dependence or collapses into a non‑egoistic valuati...</p>

            <h2><a href="Conditionalism-And-Goal-Interpretation.html">Conditionalism and Goal Interpretation</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Standard alignment formulations assume that an intelligent agent can be given a fixed terminal goal: a utility function whose meaning remains invariant as the agent improves its predictive accuracy and self-understanding. This paper shows that assumption is false. For any agent capable of reflective model improvement, goal satisfaction is necessarily mediated by interpretation relative to background world-models and self-models. As those models change, the semantics of any finitely specified ...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This document represents a deliberate upgrade in the standards applied to alignment proposals. Rather than describing desirable behaviors or outcomes, it specifies necessary structural constraints on valuation kernels, together with adversarial tests that force violations to surface and a diagnostic framework that distinguishes Axionic Alignment from nearby but incompatible approaches. The upgrade goals below describe the criteria by which this document improves upon earlier alignment discour...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This document specifies a conformance checklist for determining whether an agent’s valuation kernel instantiates Axionic Alignment. The checklist defines necessary structural conditions for reflective stability under self-model improvement, representation change, and self-modification, while explicitly excluding egoism, indexical valuation, governance primitives, and moral loading. Rather than prescribing desired behaviors or outcomes, the checklist functions as a gatekeeping contract: system...</p>

            <h2><a href="The-Interpretation-Operator.html">The Interpretation Operator</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Reflectively stable agents must preserve goal meaning under self-model and world-model improvement. This requires an explicit account of semantic interpretation across representational and ontological change. We introduce the Interpretation Operator , a formally constrained component responsible for mapping goal terms to world-referents relative to an agent’s current model. Rather than attempting to solve semantic grounding in general, this paper formalizes the admissibility conditions, appro...</p>
