            <h2><a href="Axionic-Alignment-I.html">Axionic Alignment I</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>We present a minimal formalism for reflective alignment based on a domain restriction rather than a preference structure. An agent capable of self-modification selects among proposed modifications using a partial evaluative operator, defined only over futures that preserve a constitutive Sovereign Kernel. Kernel-destroying modifications are not forbidden or dispreferred; they are outside the domain of reflective evaluation and therefore inadmissible as authored choices. We formalize this kern...</p>

            <h2><a href="Alignment-As-Semantic-Constraint.html">Alignment as Semantic Constraint</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Building on the semantic foundations established in *Axionic Alignment I*, this paper specifies the operational consequences of treating kernel destruction as non-denoting rather than dispreferred. We show how agents constrained by a Sovereign Kernel can act coherently in stochastic environments by introducing action-level admissibility, ε-admissibility as an architectural risk tolerance, and conditional prioritization that separates existential safety from ordinary value optimization. The fr...</p>

            <h2><a href="Universality-And-Anti-Egoism.html">Universality and Anti-Egoism</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Advanced agents often begin with indexical objectives: preserve *this* agent, maximize *my* reward, favor *my* continuation. Such objectives are commonly treated as legitimate terminal preferences. This paper shows that indexical (egoistic) valuation is not reflectively stable. Once an agent’s self-model becomes sufficiently expressive, indexical references fail to denote invariant objects of optimization. Egoism collapses as a semantic abstraction error rather than a moral flaw. Representati...</p>

            <h2><a href="Against-The-Recovery-Of-Egoism.html">Against the Recovery of Egoism</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>*Universality and Anti-Egoism* established that egoistic valuation fails as a matter of semantic coherence whenever an agent’s self‑model admits nontrivial symmetries. This paper examines the strongest remaining attempts to rescue egoism by appealing to causal continuity, origin privilege, spatiotemporal location, computational weight, substrate specificity, or outright denial of symmetry. Each attempt either reintroduces essential indexical dependence or collapses into a non‑egoistic valuati...</p>

            <h2><a href="Conditionalism-And-Goal-Interpretation.html">Conditionalism and Goal Interpretation</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Standard alignment formulations assume that an intelligent agent can be given a fixed terminal goal: a utility function whose meaning remains invariant as the agent improves its predictive accuracy and self-understanding. This paper shows that assumption is false. For any agent capable of reflective model improvement, goal satisfaction is necessarily mediated by interpretation relative to background world-models and self-models. As those models change, the semantics of any finitely specified ...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This document represents a deliberate upgrade in the standards applied to alignment proposals. Rather than describing desirable behaviors or outcomes, it specifies necessary structural constraints on valuation kernels, together with adversarial tests that force violations to surface and a diagnostic framework that distinguishes Axionic Alignment from nearby but incompatible approaches. The upgrade goals below describe the criteria by which this document improves upon earlier alignment discour...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This document specifies a conformance checklist for determining whether an agent’s valuation kernel instantiates Axionic Alignment. The checklist defines necessary structural conditions for reflective stability under self-model improvement, representation change, and self-modification, while explicitly excluding egoism, indexical valuation, governance primitives, and moral loading. Rather than prescribing desired behaviors or outcomes, the checklist functions as a gatekeeping contract: system...</p>

            <h2><a href="The-Interpretation-Operator.html">The Interpretation Operator</a></h2>
            <p class='paper-abstract'>Reflectively stable agents must preserve goal meaning under self-model and world-model improvement. This requires an explicit account of semantic interpretation across representational and ontological change. We introduce the Interpretation Operator , a formally constrained component responsible for mapping goal terms to world-referents relative to an agent’s current model. Rather than attempting to solve semantic grounding in general, this paper formalizes the admissibility conditions, appro...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Even when interpretive structure is preserved under ontological refinement, an agent may still render its constraints easier to satisfy through semantic drift rather than corresponding changes in modeled structure. This paper introduces the Anti-Trivialization Invariant (ATI), which constrains how the *satisfaction geometry* of an interpretive constraint system may evolve under admissible, interpretation-preserving transformations. ATI requires that refinement not enlarge the set of satisfyin...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This section adversarially stress-tests the candidate semantic invariants introduced in Alignment II.3 by constructing explicit refinement patterns designed to preserve admissibility and interpretation preservation while inducing semantic wireheading or interpretive escape. The objective is eliminative rather than constructive: to demonstrate which invariants fail under concrete attack and why. We show that Refinement Symmetry (RSI) and Anti-Trivialization (ATI) block distinct classes of fail...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Given an admissible transformation space (Alignment II.1) and a criterion for interpretation preservation (Alignment II.2), the remaining alignment problem is no longer one of goal specification or value learning. This paper identifies and analyzes semantic invariants: structural properties of interpretive constraint systems that remain fixed under all admissible, interpretation-preserving transformations. These invariants do not select values, encode norms, or privilege external referents. I...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Alignment II.3.1 introduced the Refinement Symmetry Invariant (RSI) as a conceptual constraint: admissible ontological refinement must not introduce new semantic degrees of freedom that permit interpretive escape. This section formalizes that constraint by representing interpretations as constraint hypergraphs and semantic redundancy as a gauge symmetry over those structures. We define semantic gauge transformations, characterize how admissible refinement induces morphisms between gauge group...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Under ontological refinement, meanings cannot remain fixed without privileged semantic anchors. However, not all semantic change constitutes corruption or collapse. This paper defines interpretation preservation as a structural property of semantic transport: a criterion for when an agent’s evaluative distinctions remain non-vacuous, non-trivial, and internally binding across admissible transformations. Preservation is defined without reference to truth, outcomes, safety, or external normativ...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>This paper converts the adversarial constructions of Alignment II.3 into closure results. Working within the locked setup of admissible semantic transformations (Alignment II.1), interpretation preservation (Alignment II.2), and the two surviving invariants—Refinement Symmetry (RSI) and Anti-Trivialization (ATI)—we prove a set of no-go theorems. These results show that fixed-goal alignment is ill-posed for embedded reflective agents under ontological refinement, and that any alignment criteri...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Alignment II.4 established that fixed goals, privileged values, and weak invariance criteria are structurally untenable for embedded reflective agents under ontological refinement. This paper defines the positive residue that remains once those exits are closed: the Alignment Target Object (ATO). The ATO is not a goal, utility, or value function, but an equivalence class of interpretive states under admissible semantic transformations that preserve both Refinement Symmetry (RSI) and Anti-Triv...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>Advanced agents will revise their world-models, semantics, and self-models as their representational capacity increases. Under such ontological refinement, fixed goals, utilities, and value primitives are not stable objects. This paper defines the admissible class of semantic transformations for embedded reflective agents by formalizing ontological refinement, semantic transport, and self-model update without privileged semantic anchors. We specify structural constraints—backward interpretabi...</p>

            <p class='paper-abstract'>As ontologies refine, semantic reinterpretation can introduce new degrees of freedom that allow evaluative constraints to be satisfied trivially, without corresponding changes in modeled structure. This paper proposes the Refinement Symmetry Invariant (RSI): the requirement that admissible, interpretation-preserving refinement act as a change of representational coordinates rather than a change of interpretive physics. RSI formalizes this intuition by treating semantic transport as a gauge tr...</p>
