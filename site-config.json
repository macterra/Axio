    "long": "Axionic Agency Lab studies the conditions under which agency exists at all. We focus on self-modifying systems where the usual assumptions about choice, authorship, and responsibility break down. Our central claim is structural: when the conditions for agency fail, alignment is undefined, because there is no stable subject to which goals, corrections, or authority can apply."
