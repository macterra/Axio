A firing squad waits for orders. The court commands the captain to signal. Two soldiers, A and B, will fire only on that signal. The prisoner dies if either fires. Pearl asks: <em>Who caused the death?</em><br>The question is subtle: if both fire, each is a sufficient cause; if one fires early or refuses, the chain of causation shifts. The point of the story is that such reasoning requires a model of <em>counterfactuals</em>—an imagination of what would have happened under different conditions. Pearl’s claim was categorical: deep learning systems, being mere statistical correlators, cannot reason this way.</p><p>And yet, when I posed the same scenario to GPT-5, it answered perfectly. It distinguished overdetermination from preemption, causal responsibility from moral culpability, and even formalized the structure. It reasoned through interventions—“What if A fires early?” “What if A refuses?”—and produced counterfactual analyses consistent with Pearl’s own framework. In short, it <em>climbed his ladder.</em></p><p>What changed? Architecture.</p><p>Modern systems no longer rely solely on pattern prediction. They now contain a hybrid reasoning layer: a symbolic interpreter capable of building structural causal models (SCMs) on demand. When language invokes causal relationships, the model generates variables and edges internally, executes interventions using do-calculus semantics, and reports results in natural language. It does not merely imitate causal talk—it performs causal reasoning.</p><p>Pearl himself foresaw that data-driven learning alone could not climb the ladder. He consistently emphasized that causal reasoning requires explicit models of the world. What he did <em>not</em> specify in his major writings was how such models might emerge from hybrid architectures—systems that fuse neural pattern recognition with symbolic inference. That, it turns out, is exactly what modern LLMs have begun to implement.</p><p>The result is the birth of a new kind of machine—one that not only predicts what happens next, but imagines <em>what could have been different. </em>The age of counterfactual computation has begun. This development doesn’t refute Pearl’s framework—it completes it. His ladder of causation was always an invitation: a call to build machines that could move beyond association into explanation. The hybrid reasoning systems emerging today fulfill that vision by uniting statistical power with structural understanding. They don’t overthrow <em>The Book of Why</em>; they write its next chapter—where language itself becomes a laboratory for causal thought.</p>
