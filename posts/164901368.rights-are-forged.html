Rights are not facts about the universe. They are not discovered. They are not granted by society. They are not found in nature.</p><blockquote><p>Rights are preferences we are willing to enforce through coercion, and consider ethical to do so.</p></blockquote><p>They are contingent, agent-relative, and negotiated in the space of potential conflict. They are not truths. They are tactics.</p><p><strong>Rights Don’t Come from Nature</strong></p><p>Nature doesn’t grant rights. It imposes consequences. There is no right to life in the jungle—only survival. A deer has no “right” not to be eaten. A virus has no “right” to replicate. Rights are not observable in nature; they are absent from its logic.</p><p>Every attempt to ground rights in nature imports human preferences into what is, at base, amoral causality.</p><p><strong>Rights Don’t Come from God</strong></p><p>Invoking a divine source simply defers the problem. If rights are grounded in God's will, they are still preferences—just those of a powerful agent. You might agree or disagree, but you haven’t escaped subjectivity. You've just accepted someone else's hierarchy.</p><p>This turns moral realism into theocratic voluntarism, which collapses without belief or revelation.</p><p><strong>Rights Don’t Come from Institutions</strong></p><p>States codify rights. Courts defend them. Treaties enumerate them. But institutions don’t create rights—any more than a book creates its contents. At best, institutions recognize, enforce, or simulate rights for agents who already claim or contest them.</p><p>Rights exist before and beneath legal recognition—as preferences agents are willing to defend.</p><p><strong>So Where Do Rights Come From?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Rights arise when an agent treats a preference as important enough to enforce, and others accept that enforcement as ethical.</p></blockquote><p>That enforcement may be:</p><ul><li><p>Personal (e.g. self-defense)</p></li><li><p>Social (e.g. peer norms)</p></li><li><p>Institutional (e.g. police, courts)</p></li></ul><p>But what makes it a “right” is not that it is respected. It’s that it is <strong>asserted, defended, and justified under coercion.</strong></p><p>A right is not what you are owed. A right is what you can <strong>defend, and what others agree you may defend.</strong></p><p><strong>Equal Rights as a Design, Not a Truth</strong></p><p>Sometimes societies agree to distribute rights symmetrically—free speech, due process, property rights, etc. These are policy choices, not metaphysical facts. They reflect mutual restraint, institutional pragmatism, or moral aspirations.</p><p>They work well when:</p><ul><li><p>Agents have roughly equal power</p></li><li><p>Asymmetry creates instability</p></li><li><p>Coordination matters more than precision</p></li></ul><p>But nothing in the logic of value or agency requires equality. Only local consensus or strategic stability does.</p><p><strong>The Unavoidable Role of Coercion</strong></p><p>It would be comforting to imagine a world without coercion. A world where everyone agrees, where rights are respected out of reason or empathy alone. But that world does not exist.</p><ul><li><p>There is no stable right without the threat of enforcement.</p></li><li><p>There is no boundary without the potential for resistance.</p></li><li><p>There is no liberty without the willingness to protect it.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>A right without coercion is a suggestion. A right with coercion is a boundary.</p></blockquote><p>This does not mean coercion is good. It means coercion is structurally necessary in any system that contains real agency, real disagreement, and real stakes.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Rights Are Forged, Not Found</strong></p><p>In a world of agents with conflicting values, rights are not granted by nature or institutions. They are constructed, defended, and negotiated. They are preferences, backed by power, endorsed by principle.</p><p>You don’t have a right because you are human.<br>You have a right because you (or others) are willing to make it real.</p><p>There is no moral ledger. There is only <strong>agency, power, and the ethics of enforcement.</strong></p>
