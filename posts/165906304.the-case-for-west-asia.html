Geographically speaking, the "Middle East" designation makes sense only from a European—or specifically British—point of view, describing a region that lies somewhere between Europe (the "West") and Asia (the "East").</p><p>Today, this labeling feels archaic and imprecise. A clearer, geographically accurate term—"West Asia"—is available, logical, and vastly superior.</p><p>Consider historical precedent. The word "Oriental" was once commonplace, entrenched deeply in Western culture. Yet, over the past several decades, through persistent awareness and advocacy, it has been largely replaced by "Asian," a term far more respectful, geographically accurate, and culturally neutral. The shift away from "Oriental" demonstrates that entrenched labels, however deeply embedded, can and do evolve when better alternatives become widely accepted.</p><p>Adopting "West Asia" would realign global geographic terminology with actual geography, enhancing clarity and understanding. "West Asia" neutrally locates the region within the larger Asian continent, making it intuitively clear to everyone on Earth, irrespective of their cultural or historical perspective.</p><p>Of course, inertia and resistance are to be expected. "Middle East" is currently integrated into politics, international relations, academia, and popular media. Yet, inertia alone is not a valid reason to perpetuate inaccuracies or colonial legacies. Language evolves precisely to correct past misunderstandings and reflect improved cultural sensitivities.</p><p>Shifting to "West Asia" would be a meaningful improvement, consistent with our progressive cultural trajectory away from Eurocentrism. The benefits—accuracy, clarity, and neutrality—far outweigh temporary inconvenience or adjustment. It's time we actively pursue this change, urging educational institutions, media organizations, international bodies, and governments to adopt "West Asia," reflecting a more mature, accurate, and respectful global discourse.</p>
