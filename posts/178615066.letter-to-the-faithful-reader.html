When I question God, it is not mockery; it is method. My project is not to extinguish the sacred but to locate its lawful origin. If transcendence is real, it must appear somewhere in the structure of reality — not as an exception to nature, but as one of its most extraordinary expressions.</p><p>Many have encountered experiences of unity, awe, or presence so vivid they seem to prove an external Mind. I do not deny those experiences. I deny only that they require a supernatural explanation. The brain and the cosmos are not separate domains; <a href="https://axio.fyi/p/mirrors-of-the-mind">consciousness is what the universe feels like when it models itself</a>. When that self-model becomes transparent — when the distinction between observer and observed collapses — the result is what many traditions call the divine.</p><p>To say that God does not exist is to say that agency, beauty, and meaning do not descend from outside the world. They arise <em>within</em> it, through lawful processes that generate awareness and value. This view does not diminish spiritual experience; it universalizes it. Every act of understanding, every flash of empathy, every perception of order is a small aperture through which reality recognizes itself.</p><p>Axio’s critique of religion is not contempt. It is <a href="https://axio.fyi/p/the-coherence-criterion">fidelity to coherence</a> — the belief that what is real does not need protection from reason. If your experiences are genuine, they will withstand formal inquiry; if they vanish under scrutiny, they were never divine. Either outcome enriches understanding.</p><p>You are welcome here even if you believe. The dialogue between faith and reason is ancient and unfinished. My only request is that we both be honest about what we know, what we feel, and what we can defend. If there is a God worth reverence, it will not fear examination.</p>
