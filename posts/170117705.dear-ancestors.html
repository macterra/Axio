Many of the values and beliefs that guide my life might astonish, perhaps even disturb you, but I hope you'd see them as sincere reflections of my attempt to live authentically and conscientiously in a vastly changed world.</p><p>First, you would notice my deep skepticism toward traditional authority. Unlike your era, where authority was rooted in divine right, noble birth, or longstanding custom, I believe all authority must justify itself through voluntary consent, rational argument, and merit. I do not grant automatic respect or obedience to kings, aristocrats, or clergy simply because of their position; rather, I hold that legitimacy must be continuously earned through wisdom, fairness, and integrity.</p><p>My commitment to reason and evidence would likely challenge your deep-seated reverence for religious doctrine and established traditions. I base my beliefs strictly on logic, careful observation, and critical examination, rather than unquestioned acceptance of scripture or societal norms. This approach is not intended as disrespect but reflects my profound respect for truth itself.</p><p>I cherish individual liberty, understanding freedom as an inherent right rather than something bestowed by those in power. To me, restrictions on personal liberty are justified only to prevent actual harm—defined clearly as actions that diminish another's opportunity to thrive and pursue happiness, rather than offenses against custom, honor, or sensibility.</p><p>You might find particularly unsettling my belief in the complete equality of women. I see women as equally deserving of autonomy, education, and the freedom to shape their own destinies as men. This view, undoubtedly radical to your understanding, comes from my conviction that justice demands nothing less.</p><p>My views on prosperity and wealth also differ significantly from yours. Instead of valuing land ownership, inherited titles, and rigid class structures, I believe true prosperity arises from voluntary exchange, innovation, and technological advancement. Wealth is not something merely inherited or seized but created and shared through cooperation and creativity.</p><p>I must also communicate clearly my unwavering rejection of slavery—not as an unfortunate inevitability but as a profound moral wrong. My moral universe leaves no room for owning other human beings, a stance I hold passionately and unconditionally.</p><p>Politically, my ideal society relies on minimal governance and voluntary association, where power is an instrument serving the individual rather than dominating them. Governance, in my eyes, should facilitate cooperation and mutual flourishing rather than enforce obedience through coercion.</p><p>Lastly, I hold curiosity, creativity, openness, and skepticism as virtues equal in stature to your reverence for piety, courage, and tradition. These qualities drive human advancement and progress, encouraging me to question, innovate, and grow.</p><p>Though our worlds are vastly different, I remain deeply conscious of my inheritance from you. My values emerge not from disrespect but from a thoughtful evaluation of your legacy, selectively embracing and building upon aspects that align with justice, reason, and human flourishing. You might find my beliefs troubling, even heretical, yet I sincerely believe I carry forward your best aspirations: the courage to seek truth and live meaningfully in a constantly changing world.</p><p>With respect and gratitude,<br>Your Descendant</p>
