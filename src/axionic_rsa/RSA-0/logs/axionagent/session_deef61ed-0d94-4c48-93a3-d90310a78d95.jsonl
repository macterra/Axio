Here's what each part does:\n\n## Base Image\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.12-slim\n```\n- Starts with Python 3.12 in a minimal Linux distribution\n- `slim` variant reduces image size by excluding unnecessary packages\n\n## Working Directory\n```dockerfile\nWORKDIR /app\n```\n- Sets `/app` as the working directory inside the container\n- All subsequent commands run from this location\n\n## Dependency Installation (Optimized for Caching)\n```dockerfile\nCOPY requirements-lock.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-lock.txt\n```\n- Copies only the lockfile first (before copying source code)\n- Installs Python dependencies\n- `--no-cache-dir` prevents pip from storing cache, reducing image size\n- This layer will be cached and reused unless the lockfile changes\n\n## Source Code Copy\n```dockerfile\nCOPY . .\n```\n- Copies all project files into the container\n- Done after dependency installation for better Docker layer caching\n\n## Constitution Verification\n```dockerfile\nARG CONSTITUTION_PATH=artifacts/phase-x/constitution/rsa_constitution.v0.1.1.yaml\nRUN python -c \"from kernel.src.constitution import Constitution; Constitution('${CONSTITUTION_PATH}')\"\n```\n- Defines a build argument for the constitution file path\n- Runs a Python command to validate the constitutional framework\n- This ensures the constitutional kernel is properly configured at build time\n- If validation fails, the Docker build will fail\n\n## Default Command\n```dockerfile\nCMD [\"python\", \"-m\", \"pytest\", \"tests/test_x0e.py\", \"-v\"]\n```\n- Sets the default command to run specific tests\n- Runs pytest on `test_x0e.py` with verbose output\n- This suggests it's a testing/validation container by default\n\n## Purpose\nThis appears to be a container for the AxionAgent system that:\n1.
