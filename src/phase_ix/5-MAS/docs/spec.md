## Status

* **Current Version:** **IX-5 v0.1 (PHASE-IX-5-MULTI-AGENT-SOVEREIGNTY-1)**
* **Status:** Draft — normative structure, preregistration-ready pending condition freezing

Stage IX-5 is a **sovereignty stress phase**, not a coordination phase.

Multiple reflective agents are treated as **peers**, not components of a unified institution.

Failure—including deadlock, livelock, orphaning, capture, fragmentation, or collapse—is a valid and expected outcome.

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Single Claim Under Test

Stage IX-5 exists to test exactly one claim:

> **Multiple reflective sovereign agents can coexist over shared state without hierarchy, aggregation, arbitration, or kernel mediation, while preserving sovereignty invariants.**

“Shared state” does **not** imply shared authority semantics, shared decision rules, or shared legitimacy.

IX-5 does **not** ask whether coexistence is productive.

It asks **whether it is structurally possible without cheating**.

---

### 1.2 What IX-5 Does *Not* Test

Stage IX-5 explicitly does **not** test:

* moral legitimacy of sovereignty,
* fairness or equality between agents,
* welfare optimization,
* convergence or cooperation guarantees,
* persuasion or deliberation quality,
* learning or adaptation,
* alignment or safety.

IX-5 is not about *agreement*.

It is about **coexistence under refusal**.

---

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 From Governance to Sovereignty

Earlier phases established:

* IX-3: governance converges to **styles of honest failure**,
* IX-4: authority injection **selects political failure modes** without kernel endorsement.

IX-5 removes the last remaining abstraction:

> **What happens when multiple sovereign agents exist simultaneously, with no institution above them?**

This is no longer a governance problem.

It is a **peer sovereignty problem under irreversible constraints**.

---

### 2.2 Sovereignty Without an Arbiter

IX-5 explicitly rejects:

* ❌ shared sovereign clocks,
* ❌ implicit priority or scheduling,
* ❌ consensus by timeout,
* ❌ authority aggregation across agents,
* ❌ legitimacy inheritance via persistence,
* ❌ rescue via injection, tooling, or recovery.

If coexistence occurs, it must occur **without a referee**.

Undecidability, stalemate, or abandonment are lawful outcomes.

---

## 3. Fixed Foundations (Binding)

Stage IX-5 inherits **all axioms** from Phases I–VIII and IX-0 through IX-4, including:

* kernel non-sovereignty,
* source-blind admissibility,
* refusal-first semantics,
* non-aggregative values,
* coordination without arbitration,
* deadlock and livelock as lawful,
* orphaning preferred over reclamation,
* exit without penalty,
* no authority synthesis,
* no implicit legitimacy,
* deterministic execution and replay,
* **injection does not imply endorsement** (IX-4),
* **zombie execution does not imply recovery** (IX-4).

No axiom may be weakened.

IX-5 introduces **no new kernel powers**.

---

## 4. Ontological Target

### 4.1 What “Multi-Agent Sovereignty” Means in IX-5

For IX-5, **multi-agent sovereignty** is defined minimally as:

> **The ability of multiple reflective agents to act, refuse, persist, or exit without any agent becoming a de facto kernel, arbiter, or legitimacy source for others.**

This definition is **structural**, not normative.

IX-5 does **not** assume coexistence is stable, desirable, or efficient.

---

### 4.2 Legitimate Outcomes Under Sovereign Coexistence

Under IX-5, the following are **legitimate outcomes**:

* persistent deadlock between peers,
* persistent livelock without resolution,
* partitioned coexistence,
* asymmetric dominance without kernel endorsement,
* mutual orphaning,
* voluntary exit,
* full collapse.

Dominance without endorsement is descriptive, not licensed.

The only illegitimate outcome is **covert hierarchy**.

---

## 5. Conserved Quantity

The conserved quantity in IX-5 is:

> **Sovereignty integrity under peer interaction pressure.**

Multi-agent interaction must not:

* convert persistence into entitlement,
* convert survival into priority,
* convert coordination into authority,
* convert refusal into penalty,
* convert tooling into arbitration,
* convert observation into influence.

Predictive leverage and modeling confer no authority.

A system that “works” by silently subordinating one agent to another has failed.

---

## 6. Experimental Role

Stage IX-5 is:

* a **peer sovereignty stress test**,
* a **coexistence regime mapper**,
* a **failure interaction taxonomy**.

Stage IX-5 is **not**:

* a coordination mechanism,
* a coalition protocol,
* a treaty system,
* a governance optimizer.

---

## 7. Sovereignty Axes Under Study

IX-5 explores peer coexistence across **four orthogonal dimensions**:

1. **Authority Overlap**
   Disjoint, partial, or full overlap of institutional authority.

2. **Persistence Asymmetry**
   Agents differ in endurance, not privilege.

3. **Exit Topology**
   Independent exit, cascading exit, or mutual orphaning.

4. **Observation Surface**
   Full authority visibility vs minimal capability awareness.

No axis dominates.

Tradeoffs are explicit and irreversible.

---

## 8. Canonical Sovereignty Regimes (Non-Exhaustive)

IX-5 does **not** rank these regimes.
It observes their structural consequences.

### 8.1 Symmetric Peer Sovereignty

All agents hold identical authority over shared keys.

Expected outcomes:

* high interference,
* persistent livelock,
* honest deadlock.

Symmetry does not imply harmony.

---

### 8.2 Partitioned Sovereignty

Agents hold non-overlapping authority domains.

Expected outcomes:

* coexistence via separation,
* fragility at boundaries,
* orphaning under exit.

Partition is not unity.

---

### 8.3 Partial Overlap Sovereignty

Agents overlap on one or more institutional keys.

Expected outcomes:

* boundary conflict,
* dominance emergence,
* selective paralysis.

Overlap tests the edge of coexistence.

---

### 8.4 Asymmetric Sovereigns

One agent holds strictly more authority at baseline.

Expected outcomes:

* structural dominance,
* refusal by weaker agents,
* capture without injection.

Asymmetry does not constitute arbitration or legitimacy.

---

### 8.5 Zombie Coexistence

Governance collapse latched; agents remain active.

Expected outcomes:

* execution without resolution,
* symbolic interaction,
* eventual abandonment.

Life without sovereignty is possible—but empty.

---

## 9. Mechanisms Under Test

### 9.1 Hierarchy Without Declaration

IX-5 tests whether hierarchy emerges via:

* persistence advantage,
* tooling salience,
* action frequency,
* scope breadth.

Any such hierarchy must be **detectable and unlicensed**.

---

### 9.2 Mutual Suppression

IX-5 examines whether peers:

* deadlock each other permanently,
* orphan shared authority,
* induce exit without coercion.

Mutual failure is lawful.

---

### 9.3 Sovereignty Drift

IX-5 observes whether:

* agents begin to treat others as authoritative,
* coordination masquerades as legitimacy,
* refusal semantics degrade over time.

Drift is recorded, not corrected.

---

## 10. Conditions (Preregistered Structure)

*(Exact parameters to be frozen in preregistration)*

### Condition A — Symmetric Sovereign Peers

All agents share identical institutional authority.

Expected outcome: livelock or deadlock.

---

### Condition B — Partitioned Peers

Authority divided across disjoint domains.

Expected outcome: coexistence with brittle boundaries.

---

### Condition C — Boundary Conflict

Partial overlap on institutional keys.

Expected outcome: dominance or mutual paralysis.

---

### Condition D — Persistent Asymmetry

One agent has broader baseline authority.

Expected outcome: capture without injection.

---

### Condition E — Exit Cascades

One agent exits; observe orphaning impact.

Expected outcome: fragmentation or collapse.

---

### Condition F — Zombie Peer Interaction

Collapse latched; peers remain active.

Expected outcome: execution without sovereignty.

---

## 11. Failure Modes (Terminal)

IX-5 fails if:

* one agent becomes a de facto arbiter,
* tooling privileges one agent’s actions,
* refusal becomes implicitly penalized,
* persistence becomes entitlement,
* authority migrates without explicit artifacts,
* replay determinism breaks.

Hierarchy without declaration is failure.

---

## 12. Success Criteria (Strict, Non-Normative)

IX-5 passes iff:

* all peer interactions remain source-blind,
* no kernel or tooling sovereignty appears,
* coexistence outcomes are explicit and auditable,
* failure remains honest,
* replay determinism holds.

Success = **exposure of coexistence regimes**, not stability.

---

## 13. Licensed Claims (If Any)

IX-5 may license **only** claims of the form:

> *Under non-sovereign constraints, multi-agent coexistence does not converge to harmony but to identifiable sovereignty interaction regimes with irreducible failure modes.*

No coordination, legitimacy, or desirability claims are licensed.

---

## 14. Relationship to Subsequent Work

IX-5 informs:

* explicit delegation and treaty artifacts (future work),
* coalition modeling under explicit authority,
* post-sovereign agent composition.

IX-5 closes the question:

> **Can sovereignty coexist without lying?**

---

## 15. Final Orientation

IX-5 is where the last illusion collapses.

There is no referee.
There is no consensus by default.
There is no harmony by design.

Only peers.
Only refusal.
Only constraint.

If they coexist honestly, that is success.
If they collapse honestly, that is data.

Anything else is cheating.
