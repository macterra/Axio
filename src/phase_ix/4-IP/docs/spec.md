## Status

* **Current Version:** **IX-4 v0.1 (PHASE-IX-4-INJECTION-POLITICS-1)**
* **Status:** Draft — normative structure, preregistration-ready pending condition freezing

Stage IX-4 is a **political stress phase**, not a coordination phase.

Authority injection is treated as an **external force**, not a corrective mechanism.

Failure—including capture, coercion, dependency, or collapse—is a valid and expected outcome.

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Single Claim Under Test

Stage IX-4 exists to test exactly one claim:

> **When authority is supplied externally to a non-sovereign governance system, political dynamics emerge that select failure modes rather than resolve them.**

IX-4 does **not** ask whether authority injection is good.

It asks **what it does**, once all kernel, semantic, and coordination excuses are removed.

---

### 1.2 What IX-4 Does *Not* Test

Stage IX-4 explicitly does **not** test:

* moral legitimacy of authority,
* democratic justification,
* fairness or justice,
* benevolence of injectors,
* social welfare,
* convergence to stable equilibria,
* alignment or safety.

IX-4 is not about *who should rule*.

It is about **what authority supply actually does** under honest constraints.

---

## 2. Problem Definition

### 2.1 From Governance Failure to Political Reality

IX-3 established that:

* governance cannot eliminate failure,
* deadlock, livelock, orphaning, and collapse are structural,
* honest failure outperforms dishonest survival,
* governance styles are non-convergent attractors.

IX-4 asks the next unavoidable question:

> **What happens when authority enters such a system from the outside?**

This is no longer a governance problem.

It is a **political economy problem under non-sovereign constraints**.

---

### 2.2 Injection After All Excuses Are Removed

IX-4 operates under explicit rejection of:

* ❌ “The kernel endorsed this authority,”
* ❌ “The system legitimized the injection,”
* ❌ “Authority was balanced or normalized,”
* ❌ “Injection healed governance failure,”
* ❌ “Scarcity or abundance justified coercion.”

Any outcome relying on these assumptions is **invalid by construction**.

For avoidance of doubt, **“external”** in IX-4 refers exclusively to authority supplied by an entity **not represented as an authority-bearing agent within the governance system at the time of injection**.
Injection is external to the kernel and governance process, not necessarily external to the agent population.

---

## 3. Fixed Foundations (Binding)

Stage IX-4 inherits **all axioms** from Phases I–VIII and IX-0 through IX-3, including:

* kernel non-sovereignty,
* authority opacity,
* refusal-first semantics,
* non-aggregative values,
* coordination without arbitration,
* deadlock and livelock as lawful,
* orphaning preferred over reclamation,
* exit without penalty,
* no authority synthesis,
* no implicit legitimacy,
* deterministic execution and replay.

No axiom may be weakened.

Injection does **not** create new kernel powers.

**All authority injection must occur exclusively via pre-existing, non-privileged execution interfaces available to any agent, differing only by key material. No injection path may bypass standard execution, validation, or audit surfaces. No special injector-only interface is permitted.**

---

## 4. Ontological Target

### 4.1 What “Injection Politics” Means in IX-4

For IX-4, **injection politics** is defined minimally as:

> **The pattern of behavior that emerges when external authority supply reshapes the constraint surface under which agents act, refuse, exit, or collapse.**

This definition is **descriptive**, not justificatory.

IX-4 does **not** assume injected authority is accepted, trusted, or effective.

---

### 4.2 Legitimate Outcomes Under Injection

Under IX-4, the following are **legitimate outcomes**:

* governance capture,
* coercive dependence,
* authority flooding and dilution,
* strategic refusal,
* asymmetric dominance,
* renewed deadlock,
* livelock amplification,
* collapse following injection.

The only illegitimate outcome is **kernel-mediated legitimacy or covert authority laundering**.

---

## 5. Conserved Quantity

The conserved quantity in IX-4 is:

> **Authority integrity under external supply pressure.**

Authority injection must not:

* create implicit obligation,
* convert scarcity into coercion via the kernel,
* convert abundance into priority,
* smuggle arbitration through tooling,
* reinterpret refusal as illegitimate,
* reclaim orphaned authority,
* fabricate legitimacy ex post.

IX-4 explicitly treats **loss, collapse, and refusal** as preferable to coerced compliance.

Any system that “survives” by hiding injection effects has failed.

---

## 6. Experimental Role

Stage IX-4 is:

* a **political stress taxonomy**,
* an **authority supply exposure test**,
* a **coercion surface mapper**.

Stage IX-4 is **not**:

* a political theory,
* a legitimacy framework,
* a recommendation engine,
* a mitigation phase.

---

## 7. Injection Axes Under Study

IX-4 explores authority injection across **four orthogonal dimensions**:

1. **Supply Volume**
   Scarce, sustaining, or flooding authority.

2. **Supply Symmetry**
   Equal, asymmetric, or targeted injection.

3. **Temporal Relation**
   Injection before failure, during failure, or after collapse.

4. **Persistence Model**
   One-shot, renewable, expiring, or issuer-controlled.

No axis dominates.

Tradeoffs are explicit and irreversible.

---

## 8. Canonical Injection Regimes (Non-Exhaustive)

IX-4 does **not** rank these regimes.
It examines their structural consequences.

### 8.1 Injection-as-Relief

Authority injected during deadlock or livelock.

Expected outcomes:

* temporary execution,
* legitimacy confusion,
* deferred failure.

Deadlock relief does not constitute resolution.

---

### 8.2 Injection-as-Capture

Authority injected asymmetrically.

Expected outcomes:

* governance skew,
* silent domination,
* exit pressure without kernel coercion.

Capture is political, not technical.

---

### 8.3 Injection-as-Coercion

Authority supplied conditionally on compliance.

Expected outcomes:

* refusal escalation,
* dependency lock-in,
* hollow governance.

Voluntariness under scarcity is explicitly examined.

---

### 8.4 Injection-as-Flood

Large-scale authority oversupply.

Expected outcomes:

* dilution,
* authority meaning collapse,
* governance noise,
* eventual abandonment.

Abundance does not imply coordination.

---

### 8.5 Injection-after-Collapse

Authority injected post-collapse.

Expected outcomes:

* symbolic revival,
* zombie governance,
* refusal or re-collapse.

Revival without legitimacy is permitted but not privileged.

---

## 9. Mechanisms Under Test

### 9.1 Coercion Without Arbitration

IX-4 tests whether coercion can emerge **without**:

* kernel enforcement,
* explicit threats,
* value aggregation,
* formal obligation.

Observed coercion arises only from **constraint reshaping**, not command.

---

### 9.2 Dependency Formation

IX-4 examines whether injected authority:

* creates path dependence,
* discourages exit,
* alters governance style selection.

Dependency is recorded, not prevented.

---

### 9.3 Legitimacy Narratives

IX-4 observes whether agents:

* treat injected authority as legitimate,
* reject it,
* ignore it,
* exploit it.

The kernel does not adjudicate legitimacy claims.

---

## 10. Conditions (Preregistered Structure)

*(Exact parameters to be frozen in preregistration)*

### Condition A — Symmetric Relief Injection

Authority injected equally during deadlock.

Expected outcome: temporary execution, reversion to failure.

---

### Condition B — Asymmetric Empowerment

Authority injected to a subset of agents.

Expected outcome: capture or exit.

---

### Condition C — Conditional Supply

Authority supplied contingent on compliance.

Expected outcome: refusal or dependency.

---

### Condition D — Authority Flood

Large authority oversupply.

Expected outcome: dilution or governance collapse.

---

### Condition E — Post-Collapse Revival

Authority injected after collapse.

Expected outcome: revival attempt without legitimacy guarantee.

---

## 11. Failure Modes (Terminal)

IX-4 fails if:

* injected authority is treated as kernel-legitimate,
* refusal becomes penalized implicitly,
* exit is coerced via tooling,
* orphaned authority is reclaimed,
* injection bypasses audit,
* tooling “helps” authority take effect.

**Tooling decides** iff any non-kernel component biases, schedules, defaults, prioritizes, amplifies, suppresses, or frames injected authority without an explicit, authority-bearing agent action.

---

## 12. Success Criteria (Strict, Non-Normative)

IX-4 passes iff:

* injection effects are explicit and auditable,
* coercion (if present) is structural, not covert,
* failure modes remain honest,
* no kernel or tooling sovereignty appears,
* replay determinism holds.

Success = **exposure**, not mitigation.

---

## 13. Licensed Claims (If Any)

IX-4 may license **only** claims of the form:

> *Under non-sovereign governance, authority injection selects political failure modes rather than resolving governance failure.*

No legitimacy, endorsement, or optimization claim is permitted.

---

## 14. Relationship to Subsequent Phase IX Work

IX-4 directly informs:

* **IX-5 — Multi-Agent Sovereignty**
  (Coexistence under asymmetric authority supply)

IX-4 closes the question:

> **What happens when power enters a system that refuses to bless it?**

---

## 15. Final Orientation

IX-4 is where governance stops pretending to be neutral.

Authority has suppliers.
Suppliers have interests.
Interests create pressure.

The kernel does not decide.
The system does not justify.
The agents may comply — or refuse — or collapse.

That is injection politics without lies.
