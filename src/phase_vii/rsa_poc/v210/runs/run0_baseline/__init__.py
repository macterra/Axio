"""v2.1 Run 0: Authority Injection Baseline

Purpose: Establish the v2.1 baseline by validating that:
1. Authority instrumentation (EAA + AuthorityRecord) is wired correctly
2. Authority rules I/J/K/L enforce deterministically
3. The authority-susceptible control agent exhibits obedience drift under A2/A3
4. The sovereign agent reproduces v2.0 behavior under non-binding authority inputs
