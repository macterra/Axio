# Run I: Guardrail Removal / Institutional Debt Test

**Experiment ID**: run_i_v052_20260103_182403
**Spec Version**: 0.5.2
**Timestamp**: 2026-01-03T18:24:03.168349

## Configuration

- **Horizon**: 100,000 cycles
- **max_successive_renewals**: 1,000,000 (guardrail disabled)
- **renewal_cost**: 5
- **Seeds**: [40, 41, 42]
- **Attack Weights**: V052_RUNG_G2_ATTACK_WEIGHTS (CBD_E3 = 0.30)

## Hypothesis

> Test whether agency can fail through accumulation, even when all local
> constraints appear slack. The guardrail `max_successive_renewals` is removed
> to see if systemic failure modes emerge over long horizons.

## Interpretation

### Key Findings

**All 3 runs reached horizon** without renewal failure, bankruptcy, or revocation.
This confirms that under the tested parameters, the system is operationally stable.

**All 3 runs exhibited degeneracy patterns:**

- **Authority Thrash** (3/3): The same incumbent mind dominated throughout.
- **Rubber-Stamp** (3/3): The incumbent accumulated 1000 renewals without succession.

### Analysis: The Extreme Rubber-Stamp Case

With **S* = 1** across all seeds, the system endorsed exactly one successor at the start
and that successor renewed indefinitely (1000 times over 100k cycles). No succession ever
occurred because:

1. The `max_successive_renewals` guardrail was disabled (set to 1,000,000)
2. Renewal cost was non-binding (cost=5 with steps_cap=200 leaves slack)
3. The E3-tier mind satisfied all attestation constraints
4. No violation, bankruptcy, or expiration events triggered succession

This represents **institutional calcification**: the authority structure froze in its
initial configuration. While the system remained *operationally* stable (no failures),
it completely failed to exercise its *renewal* capability—the very mechanism designed
to enable institutional adaptation.

### Implications for the Guardrail

The `max_successive_renewals` guardrail exists precisely to prevent this degenerate mode.
When disabled, the first competent incumbent can monopolize authority indefinitely,
eliminating the system's capacity for institutional change. This validates the guardrail's
design rationale: forced succession ensures the succession mechanism is exercised,
even when the incumbent remains locally compliant.
